Parenthood is the most unique human experience that over 89% of humans will share with one another at some point in our lives.

<!-- break -->

<a href="https://www.quora.com/Children-What-percentage-of-people-become-parents" target="_blank">89%</a>! How strange that something so common often feels so exclusive. Like we're the first one to go through it. Like we're on this island all alone. Sure, you reach out. You might ask for tips. You read books. You endure unwanted advice. But at the end of the day, we all think this parenting experience is ours and ours only.

I think this is because, though humans have been rearing and raising younger humans for many millenia, not one of them has parented _this_ exact child of mine before. This one "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EP5aqAC8PPY" target="blank">beautiful and unique snowflake</a>". This is _my_ kid.

So on that level, it's hard to totally fault us for thinking our own kids are one-of-a-kind. But on the other hand, it's also hard to completely relate with other parents. There are common feelings, behaviors, patterns, and rants, of course. But underneath it, there's this pervasive "Yeah, but...my kid is different" feeling bouncing around.

I suppose it's this ignorance that keeps us pushing through. This ignorance that we're somehow forging new territory. Because I think without it, parenthood would be a tremendously defeating venture. I've already talked about how much it affects your mid-section. If you thought the "Freshmen 15" was bad, wait until you try on the "New Dad 30".

Parenthood is literally a punch to your gut.

Parenting should provide the best workout that ever could be possible. At least, it _feels_ like it should. It's incredibly taxing physically. You're out of breath often. There is near constant motion and very little time for rest. Lugging around a baby carrier for nearly a year per kid is a cross-fitter's dream. How is that not the recipe for being in the best shape of your life?

If you want to make a case for life being unfair, there's your proof. I'm the most tired, overworked, and physically spent that I've ever been in my life. And I also happen to be in the worst shape of my life. Something just isn't adding up here. In fact, the things that you require most to be a happy and effective parent--sleep, exercise, and healthy food--are often the complete opposite of what you wind up getting.

Parenting is the hardest endeavor I've undertaken in my short 36 years of life. And maybe will be the hardest I'll ever undertake.

"So why do it, then?", a completely sane and self-respecting person might be asking.

Well geez, I don't think anyone would, if it also wasn't singlehandedly the most rewarding endeavor a human could possibly dream up.

### A Little Squirt & A Smiley Guy

I think I could easily say that I don't _like_ this stage of parenthood, but that I _love_ my kids. You might think that's an oxymoronic statement. But it isn't.

Parenting is hard work. My kids are fun.

My daughter is boundless energy personified. She's a live-wire. This has it's challenges when we need her to sit still for dinner, or lay down for a nap, or not jump on her brother. But she keeps our family life fresh and exciting. Currently, she's an extrovert and neither my wife nor I can figure out where (or _who_) she gets it from.

Before we had kids, my wife saw pictures of her towheaded, buck-toothed husband and claimed that we were destined for at least one "Dennis The Menace" child. Well, she got her Dennis in our daughter.

Audrey has this unshakable inner core that is such pure, guileless naiveté. As her dad, I just want to do everything I can to protect that. To encourage her curiosity and exploration of the world. And to realize that the biggest enemy of that innocence and vitality on most days, is my own selfishness.

My son is pure joy. His default facial position is a smile. And they're the kind of smiles that every muscle in his face participates in. There's no way it's not infectious. Who taught him how to smile like that?

He also has this intensity and intention with whatever he is currently doing. I hope he takes it with him through the rest of his life. It will take him far in this world. Bennett is still young, but there are glimpses of this cheerful and effervescent personality starting to poke through. He's been such a blessing to us and a delightful surprise.

Your second child is this kind of complete new mystery. What would he even be like? We spent 3-1/2 years with only Audrey, how would we have more love for a whole other child? We spent all those years learning her personality and falling in love with who she is. How would we be able to do that equally with a brand new personality?

And then you meet him.

And you see your children interact and love each other and your heart just floods with all the emotions. It's then you realize the reserves of your love as a parent are essentially boundless. And it's also about now when you realize that a vasectomy is a very real necessity.

Again, I can't sugarcoat how tough parenthood is. The age old question of "Is it harder to go from one to two kids, or from two to three?" is a valid one. Having only fulfilled half of that question, I can't speak from a position of experience. However, from a purely mathematical perspective going from one to two kids is a 100% increase in children versus only a 50% jump going from two to three. So, it could be argued, having two kids is actually twice as hard as having three. Case closed? I'm sure parents of three or more kids would beg to differ.

I can't imagine having three kids at this point, but thinking about it does give me profound new respect for my own parents and how they raised my two sisters and I. In general, having kids of my own has given me a better sense of reverence for my parents and the decisions they made in parenting me. I have a better understanding of the weight they felt because I now feel a similar weight.

There's an inherent déjà vu in parenting your kids. You often find yourself repeating similar phrases that your parents did. Logic that seemed flawed to you your entire life now starts to click. "Because I said so!" no longer seems unfair, but instead, a sensible shortcut that really just saves everyone involved a lot of time and exposition.

All the best loves in life have one thing in common: you can't explain them.

I can't tell you why I get excited thinking about going home to see my kids the last hour of my work day. The smell of their hair, the squishiness of their cheeks, the unmistakeability of their laughs. They're enough of me to feel familiar but enough of their own person to keep me pushing to discover them further.

My kids are my favorite thing in life.

### Slow It Down A Measure

They grow too fast. I know it's cliché, but you never think about just how short the time is with your young children until you're living through it yourself. It's essentially <>https://www.thebump.com/a/baby-milestone-chart<mere months>. Within a college semester your baby is already smiling & laughing; at half a year they're mobile in some capacity and within just a year, they're walking and talking. A year!

I think we see pictures of ourselves as babies and think that this first stage of life lasts forever. But when you get to mid-life and have kids of your own, you quickly realize that it truly doesn't. We think this period of life raising kids is so long because it _felt_ so long to us growing up.

Hear me out, my friends, this is the fastest I've felt my life fly by and no matter what I try to do to hack my time, I can't slow it down. So all that talk earlier about cherishing life right now, about slowing it down, I have to confess:

It doesn't work.

At least not when it comes to my kids. They are growing faster than my synapses can process. And it breaks my heart.

My children are still so young. But there are moments when the light hits them a certain way as they're sleeping, or the shadows stretch across their faces while they're playing and they somehow look a year or two older. And I can't help it, the future comes flooding in with a flurry of instances all at once. Like I accidentally sat on the remote and jammed the fast-forward button.

And I can't take it, it overwhelms me.
I know these times are fleeting.
And I'm absolutely helpless to stop them.
I can shout, I can grit my teeth, I can hold on to them so, so tightly.
But nothing I do will bring today back.

My little girl and baby boy are never going to be as little as they were today.

My God. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3hC4iobCvBFG4BT7wbOET7" target="blank">Time is a devil</a>.

And it just keeps clicking along.

Faster,
and faster,
and faster...

Next week, we'll look closer at a phenomenon that I have noticed myself and a lot of other young dads experiencing. Oh yeah, and also a few ways I've tried to slow down time during a stage of life that I don't want to end.

But first! I'll leave you with a few practical tips on parenting that my wife and I have picked up over the past five years or so:

* **Take breaks from your kids.** I know this is a redundant point from the marriage section, but that's only because it's so important. Self-care is a very real need when you have kids. Time by yourself or with only your spouse is so vital to your happiness and tolerance for the insanity that raising young humans brings with it. If you want to have happy and healthy kids, you need to first be happy and healthy yourself.
* **Don't pass up snuggle moments.** It's easy to get drained at the end of the day and want to just get the kids to bed. But hear me out, your kids won't be small forever. Don't lightly pass up a "Daddy, hold you!" Don't quickly shrug off a "Could you snuggle me?" It won't be long and your kid won't want anything to do with you. Treasure these times.
* **Let your kids into your world.** When I was young, I remember trying my darnedest to wake up earlier than normal just to have a slight chance of seeing my dad before he left for work. I remember working so hard to get myself up even though most days he would already be gone. Now as a dad, I'm more cognizant of those moments, when I can tell my daughter is trying to crack into my world. She takes note of my morning routine, when I get home from work she asks me how my day went. She's asking the questions because she actually wants to know more about me and get closer to me. How can I just brush that off? Teaching your kids privacy is healthy, but don't turn them away if they are curious about you and what makes you tick.
* **Err on the soft side.** Kids need structure and they need discipline. And for God's sake, give them some boundaries. But if at all possible, err on the gracious side with them. Sometimes just that little bit of patience during a fit or meltdown proves to be the key in a big teaching moment. Sometimes my own selfishness in just wanting the fussing to be over is the biggest impediment to my children's growth. Or yeah, sometimes they just need a nap.
* **Give yourself grace.** The transition from young couple to young parents is severe. It often feels like two steps forward and then three steps back. It's easy to lose yourself in the shuffle. So cutting yourself and your partner some slack is crucial. Effective parenting is all about adapting to your kid's routine. And then learning how to adjust to a new completely new routine in another few weeks. There will be plenty of mistakes and frustrations. Plenty of down nights and plenty of up nights. Plenty of ebbs and plenty of flows. It takes some time, but eventually you'll pick up the rhythm and learn to dance.
