# Hi, my name is Ryan.

### Here's a bit more about me.

![](/assets/images/DSC0933-small.jpg "Hey, it's me!")

First off, I have to let you in on a little secret.  
See the trendy glasses I'm wearing in that picture up there? Well, they're fake. As in, they are doing nothing more for my eyes than if I wasn't wearing them.  
I'm a millenial, but just barely. I made the cut on the front end of the generation by just a year or two. This is evidenced by the fact that I'm writing to you right now in blog form and not through Snapchat. I consider myself on the sufficiently and properly bandaged side of the bleeding edge.  
I'm a dad and a husband and so you're going to see that reflected in far too much of what I write about. I'm going to go ahead and just pre-apologize for all the gushing and right here to save myself the trouble later on.  
Some of my interests  
So why am I writing in a blog in the year 2018 (or beyond) instead of say, on Medium
