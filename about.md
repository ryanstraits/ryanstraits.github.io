# Hi, my name is Ryan.

![](/assets/images/DSC0933-small.jpg "Hey, it's me!")

First off, I have to let you in on a little secret.

See the trendy glasses I'm wearing in that picture right up there? Well, here's the deal: they're kind of fake. As in, they are doing nothing more for my eyes than if I wasn't wearing them. That's weird right? My friends that know this embarrassing fact about me have not been shy in telling me as much.

So then, why start off a section called "About Me" with such an odd, revealing factoid about myself? Well, because that's kind of what I am hoping the purpose of this blog is going to be. As I approach the middle chapters of my life, I have come to realize that for one, I'm not nearly as cool as I think myself to be

Now, why am I choosing to bare my soul in blog form in the year 2018 (and beyond) instead of say, on Medium or something similar. Well,

##### Here's a bit more about me and where we go from here. 

I'm a millennial, but just barely. I made the cut on the front end of the generation by just a year or two. This is evidenced by the fact that I am indeed writing to you right now in blog form and not through Snapchat. I consider myself on the sufficiently and properly bandaged side of the bleeding edge.  
I'm a dad and a husband, so you're going to see that reflected in far too much of what I write about. I'm going to go ahead and just pre-apologize for all the gushing and fawning right here to save myself the trouble later on.  
Besides wearing no-prescription Warby Parker's, here are a few other random tidbits about me. My favorite TV show is and always will be MacGyver. My favorite musician is Bruce Springsteen. I still consider Seth Cohen [a fashion icon](https://twitter.com/ryanstraits/status/817788129298042886). Chocolate chip cookies > donuts. By day, I'm a Project Manager and deal with far more important matters

Lastly, I wear the glasses because I like them and I damn well want to.

If you're new to this blog, the best place to start is on my series on growing up & getting older, I call it "A Midlife Guide To Growing Up" and it encompasses just about everything I'm trying to do with this blog. Establish a place to be real and to hopefully help others feel less weird or alone in such a strange time of life.

Next, if you're truly feeling crazy you can scroll through my 40+ pages of archives. Because here's another weird thing about me. I am a serial archivist and with this blog, I've collated nearly every single blog post that I've ever published, going way back to the Xanga blog I _regularly_ posted on from 2003 to 2008. There are some real
