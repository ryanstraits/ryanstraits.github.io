<p>Aging is weird.</p>

<!-- break -->

<p>Your thirties reveal that–like some cruel plot twist early in the second act–your body has just been out to betray you all along. It’s slowly been switching from your side to the one of some unknowable, unrepentant force of evil. And no matter how hard you try to coax and convince it, it’s just not coming back.</p>

<p>Things that you used to enjoy–like sleeping in, eating, showering, and pick-up games of any sport–now become reflections on your fragility.</p>

<p>I can’t sleep-in past 8 a.m. now without my back feeling like it’s going to dislodge a vertebrae. Eating becomes a tally of how many pounds a meal will add to my waistline and how many miles are required to run/bike them off. Showering hits a whole new level of creepiness now as you horrifically gaze in the mirror at this saggier, hairier, alternate-reality version of your 20 year-old-self staring back at you. And this happens everyday.</p>

<p>And well, you just <em>hurt</em> after any and all prolonged periods of activity.</p>

<p>You hurt a lot.</p>

<h3 id="ryan-tries-a-tri">Ryan Tries A Tri</h3>

<p>A little over a year ago, I found myself gifted with the rarest of all experiences once you become a parent: a weekend all to myself. My wife had taken the kids to visit family out of town, and I guess the scarcity of this type of scenario in my life must’ve went straight to my head. Because the undeniably hair-brained scheme that I hatched coming out of that time alone wasn’t something that normal, dad-bod Ryan wouldn’t have chosen to do on his own:</p>

<p>I decided I was going to swim across a lake.</p>

What have I gotten myself into?? Well, needing a bit of a kick in the pants to lose a few pounds and round myself back into shape, I decided to sign up as my work's representative in the triathlon for KC Corporate Challenge. It's a sprint triathlon (500m swim/10mi bike/5k run) so I'm not THAT insane. But this is a big deal to me. So I thought I'd document my training over the next 12 weeks here. Hopefully by Father's Day, I'll be ready!</a></p> <p style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;">A post shared by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/triingryan/" style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;" target="_blank"> Ry Tries A Tri</a> (@triingryan) on <time style=" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;" datetime="2017-03-27T03:44:31+00:00">Mar 26, 2017 at 8:44pm PDT</time></p></div></blockquote>
<script async="" defer="" src="//www.instagram.com/embed.js"></script>

<p>Now, as crazy as this idea sounds coming from me, I feel the need to back up a few steps and explain myself. Up until this fateful weekend, I had been mulling over representing my employer in the Kansas City Corporate Challenge’s Triathlon. And this wasn’t a normal triathlon, it was a sprint triathlon, i.e. the shortest one there is. A 500m swim, 10 mile bike ride, and 5K run. Really, not all that bad.</p>

<p>And so, given a chill, peaceful weekend and a chance to drive out to the park where the triathlon was going to be held, I started to feel a swelling sense of destiny: this was something I needed to do to prove to myself that I was…I don’t know, a man I guess? And it was on Father’s Day yet to boot! And honestly, the idea of a triathlon didn’t scare me…except for that 500m swim.</p>

<p>As I’ve discussed in the previous post, I had been cycling for several years and 10 miles wasn’t easily achievable for me. I also knew I could hobble my way to the finish line of a 5K. But the swimming portion, hoo boy. That was going to be my weakest link. And so therein lied the challenge. I had 12 weeks until the race to learn how to swim <em>and</em> swim well enough to not die in the middle of a lake.</p>

<p>I had been thinking for a while, up until the triathlon idea was presented to me, that swimming might be a viable new fitness avenue for me to explore. It’s a great cardiovascular workout that works nearly every major muscle group while <em>also</em> being very low impact on your joints. It also helped that our gym at the time had a very nice lap pool.</p>

<p>So I planned out an extensive training regimen. I enlisted the help of a friend who regularly competes in triathlons to teach me how to <em>actually</em> swim. And I started documenting my journey on Instagram for accountability. I got off to a <em>great</em> start.</p>

<p>And then, as they say, life happened.</p>

<p>My wife and I decided to sell our house a month later. This meant late nights painting rooms, landscaping patios, and selling room-fulls of junk. And it also meant less nights at the gym and in the pool.</p>

<p>And so I guess when they tell you that your first swim in the lake for a triathlon shouldn’t be on race day, they probably have a good reason. Because I did attempt to swim across the lake on Father’s Day 2017…</p>

<p>And I only made it roughly a quarter of the way.</p>

<p>An issue I had encountered during a few of my longer swims hit me soon after I got to around the 100m mark of the swim: foot cramps. Once they hit you, you’re done for. So I doggy-paddled to shore with my tail between my legs and thankfully, the race officials graciously allowed me to finish the cycling and running portions, keeping my pride mostly intact. All-in-all, it was a fun day and I was happy to have a lofty goal to motivate me when it comes to fitness.</p>

<p>But my experience with the triathlon last year started to make me aware of a theme developing in my attempts at fitness: that of my mind saying “Yes” to new physical challenges, and my body just flatly telling me “No”.</p>

I can confirm that yesterday I accomplished both of those goals! Unfortunately though, I did not technically finish my first triathlon yesterday. Due to my foot/toe cramping up (again!) roughly 100m in to the swim leg, I had to withdraw and turn in my timing chip. They allowed me to finish the rest of the competition and I'm pretty proud of how well I fared in the biking &amp; running portions. So I guess I'm a "tryathlete" and not a triathlete today, hah. Overall, it was a lot of fun! KCCC is such a well run &amp; organized event. I was very impressed. As for my tri future, I can't say right now. I don't know if I'll regroup to try again at another event or just focus more intensely on training for a bike race, a sport I really love and would enjoy competing at more seriously. We'll see! But there's one thing I do know for sure: it's unwise to try to sell your house and train for a triathlon at the same time! 😜</a></p> <p style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;">A post shared by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/triingryan/" style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;" target="_blank"> Ry Tries A Tri</a> (@triingryan) on <time style=" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;" datetime="2017-06-20T02:19:39+00:00">Jun 19, 2017 at 7:19pm PDT</time></p></div></blockquote>

<h3 id="rarefied-air">Rarefied Air</h3>

<p>For all the frustrations and disappointment with your body that occur in the middle third of life, there is obviously a richness to this stage of aging that I’ve been skirting. For all the fresh wrinkles, new aches, and extra pounds, there’s this airy plateau of transcendence that can only be reached once you crest that first hill of your thirties. A plateau that gives you a clearer view of your life and how little of it you actually have left.</p>

<p>I’ve made it this far and my body is still intact. I still have the majority of my hair (though it’s the minority I’ve lost that bothers me) and some bounce left in my step. What do I have to worry about? Just squeezing every ounce of life out of this old thing that I can in the next 50 years or so, that’s all.</p>

<p>It’s not rosy but I think having a firm grasp on your finality is a good thing. It makes you try harder, push deeper, and commit more fully. You are much less likely to half-ass your way through life when you have an achy back or a creaky knee constantly reminding you that your body is trending in a downward direction.</p>

<hr />

<p>In last week’s post, I noted an MIT study that claimed our “fluid intelligence” peaked at age 20. If you actually clicked the link and read on from the first few paragraphs, you’d realize that I wasn’t entirely being truthful with what I had reported back. Oops.</p>

<p>Yes, some of our cognitive abilities peak when we’re younger, but many more are still ascending upwards through our thirties and even into our fifties and sixties. Facial recognition and visual short term memory both peak in your early thirties, says the MIT study. Our vocabulary and the mental skills needed to evaluate other’s emotional states peak in our forties and fifties. So that’s certainly something to look forward to!</p>

<p>And really, it makes sense, doesn’t it? My mind doesn’t feel all that old. In fact, it’s still on point. Our thirties are the years to take advantage of our superior mental acuity.</p>

<p>Middle age is the unique period of your life when you will actually know more than both your kids <em>and</em> your parents. If there was a bell curve on peak intelligence, your thirties would undeniably be right around the crest. You’re probably not going to be more “with it” mentally than you are in your thirties.</p>

<p>This is a gift, my friends, and we would do well to take advantage.</p>

<hr />

<p>Now, I know there will be folks several years my senior that will no doubt scoff at a 36-year-old complaining about feeling old. I get it. I know I have plenty of aging, aches, and probably pounds left ahead of me.</p>

<p>But I think that if you polled a few individuals down the road a ways, and asked them to recall what age range they first started to feel the full force of aging, I’m pretty certain the consensus would be:</p>

<p>Your thirties are definitely when you start to feel <em>old</em>.</p>

<hr />

<p>Next week, we’ll dive into just what a grown up soul might look like. Basically, it’s kind of like an old soul, but cooler.</p>
