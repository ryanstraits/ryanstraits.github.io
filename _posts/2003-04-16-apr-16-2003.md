<span style="font-family:Verdana;">listening to: david gray - the other side (i'm not as eclectic as you may think...it was on smallville last nite...ok?)</span>

so this has been an action-packed week so far filled with "spell-binding" drama productions (i saw my sis's high school performance of <em>godspell</em>)...cell phones taking extended swims in toilet bowls...non-stop nintendo game play...and intense bocce ball games played w/ old italian men...

yeah so now i'm starting to get addicted to ebay...yup THE ebay...since my cell phone is not quite in working order anymore i enlisted the help of the popular sucking internet vaccuum where u can bid on perfectly good stuff for low dollar amounts...you can also sell your unwanted items and your soul along with them...anyways i found a phone that's actually better than mine for like $25...i'm pretty stoked and now all i want to do is find crap on there for less than it should be sold for...and if i can't get something for the price i want then it's fun just to bid on something so the price goes up and ticks other people off...

so i started writing the soundtrack to a movie today...to what movie you ask? i'm not quite sure yet...no noteworthy directors have called me up as of late...too bad...it's gonna be a darn good soundtrack too...i just sat down at the piano and started playing and movie soundtrack-like sounds came out...maybe it's cuz i've been in a big movie watching kick lately...i watched fight club for the first time on monday...although pretty raunchy, it was very dark and interesting...i quite enjoyed it...today i watched the usual suspects...probably my favorite movie of all time...it gets better everytime i see it...

"meet me on the other side...honey, if i'm honest i still don't know what life is"
