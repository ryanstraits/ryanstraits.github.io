so thanks for the outpouring of flattering comments on my last entry...for those of you hoping for more of the same you'll probably be disappointed...inspired moments such as the one that led to my previous post only come once every full moon...so before i even start i want to apologize for this dull and insipid entry...i just haven't felt very motivated to write about anything remotely significant recently...so today i'll just talk about random things i guess...

<!-- break -->

for those of you who haven't been able to form an opinion on this new movie "saved!" (it's a satirical take on the christian subculture starring goodie-goodies-gone-bad like mandy moore and macaulay culkin)...i came across a very well written and insightful review by a christian no less...you may be surprised by what he says...<a href="http://www.cmcentral.com/videofilm/29.html" target="_blank">here's the link</a> ...read it and then draw your own conclusions...i think we as christians need to take some form of a stance on this because much of the world will be watching for our response...i'm up for seeing it but whether i do or don't will ulitmately come down to the content...

for all you movie buffs out there i've added another movie to my "most anticipated list"...is it just me or does that movie "napoleon dynamite" look really darn quirky and entertaining? i've been reading up on it and alot of people are calling it the next "bottle rocket"...it has all the makings to justify those claims...low budget...first-time, unknown director...offbeat characters...i think it's worth the money to at least see if it lives up to the hype...now if i could just find a theater that's playing it...

the days sure seem to be passing by quicker lately...these past few weeks have just flown by...maybe it has something to do with the constant rain we've been getting...it just doesn't seem to wanna let up...not only does the drop in barometric pressure make my hair and eyes behave erratically but cloudy/rainy days like these always seem to have a way of making everything seem surreal don't they? maybe that's how i've slipped through these past few weeks with little to no awareness of my surroundings whirling by me...

maybe it's the fact that i'm leaving for california this sunday...i can't believe it's here already...i haven't been able to contain my excitement for this trip...i hope those of you who remember will pray for those of that are going...i think God is going to be doing some incredible stuff in all of us...not the least of which is myself...i pray that he'll take me and show me where he's working...and that i would be willing to join him wherever that is...

maybe it's because i'm on the verge of something big...something new...is this how it feels right before you go over the edge?

maybe...
