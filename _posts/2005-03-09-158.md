so...time to put my measly last post out of it's misery...two whole comments...but it's my fault i do believe...i've been pretty dull lately...reticent even...which is a word i had stuck in my head all day yesterday and i really don't know how it got there...but it's a fitting description of my feelings as of late...it's probably just this horrible, yet predictable ohio weather (which hasn't let up <em>at all</em> since i begged and pleaded in my last entry)...but one can't be too sure...i just haven't been very ambitious to do anything outside the four walls of my humble abode here...

<!-- break -->

however, i have been quite the rebellious chap lately...staying up <em>way</em> too late for my current schedule of work-school-practice-sleep-work-six:forty-sleep-work-school-sleep-work-rinse-repeat...i mean it's been like 12-12:30 every night until my head hits my undeniably envious pillow...and that's late folks considering i'm up at the arse-crack of dawn, 6:30am, every morning...so i've been dragging...which leads to even more rebellious behavior...such as skipping class tonight...oops...i was just about ready to leave work today and quickly realized i had not done my lab report from last week...and then as i walked out the door it was snowing...strike two...there really was no strike three...maybe the final strike is the fact that i hate this semester of school and detest driving a half hour down and half hour back for the most hideously boring class in the entire known universe...

well i guess strike three really could be that i've been quite busy at work in the past week or so...and that could be attributed to the fact that i'm preparing to move out of my office...aaaaaaand into a cubicle...<em>yippeeee</em>...i'm not getting demoted...so much as i'm getting bumped down the engineering foodchain...i will no longer be able to claim the "fortress of solitude" as my home away from home...it's a sad day in sugarcreek, my friends...we're hiring a new position...which will actually help my job out a good bit...but they think she needs to be closer to our head engineer's office...so i'm getting bumped...oh well...i'm trying to look at it positively...work-wise it'll be better for me i think...i'll be out more in the flow of things instead of being so isolated...but all the racket and people running around by my lil' cube is going to be very grating i'm sure...just have to let my music creep up louder and louder...

so that coupled with the fact i somehow managed to convince myself that i needed a laptop has been contributing to my rampant sleep deprivation...and thus lack of creativity i'm sure...yup i bought a laptop...pretty cool deal from my friend kate...i've been busy getting it up to speed...i'm gonna use it primarly for recording and for writing...i'm pretty excited and i think it's gonna work out reeeeeeeally well...hope to start work on my first screenplay any day now...but like most things with me...

don't hold your breath...
