so i'm just sitting here installing some nifty illegal software provided by my good buddy skeet...listening to some darn fine music...and eating a few slices of greasy parlor pizza...what have you done with your friday night?

<!-- break -->

lately i've been caught up with reading movie scripts...scripts of some of my favorite movies to be exact...i guess it's normally custom to watch movies...but i've decided i enjoy reading them...how about that...i <em>read</em> movies...and you can too, actually...<a href="http://www.imsdb.com" target="_new">check it out</a>...hours of fun for everyone...

ahh the post-holiday "blahs"...they've come on good and strong this year...i didn't get the week off inbetween christmas and new years like i usually do (and look forward too achingly every season)...but the mass amounts of time spent with several old friends decidedly made up for having to go into work...that and the nice paycheck i received today, of course...

ok...well now it's time to do something about these post-week-after-the-holiday blahs...
