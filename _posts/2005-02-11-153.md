<em>i'm in a car underwater with time to kill...</em>

<!-- break -->

howdy folks...thought i'd remedy the outrageous length of the last two posts with a shorter one filled with funny and interesting things...or so i hope...

<strong>real quick like:</strong> here's a few links that i have found to be either interesting, quite hilarious or both...check them out at your own discretion:
<ul type="disc">
	<li class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><a href="http://www2.foxsearchlight.com/gardenstate/blog/" target="_new">http://www2.foxsearchlight.com/gardenstate/blog/</a> - pretty neat little weblog by "garden state" writer/director/actor/madman zach braff...if you thought the movie was great...you'll love the guy behind it...this is just his journal to talk to fans about what's going on in his world...he's a pretty funny guy...</li>
	<li class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><a href="http://www.youhavebadtasteinmusic.com/" target="_new">http://www.youhavebadtasteinmusic.com</a> - a very funny but quite scathing site setup by some guy who obviously doesn't like alternative or pop music...i do enjoy a few of the bands on the list...but i just think it's funny that this guy has the cojones to get up and do what he does...make sure you check this out...</li>
	<li class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0;"><a href="http://www.humanforsale.com/" target="_new">http://www.humanforsale.com</a> - see how much you're worth...i'm worth $2,051,866.00...geesh...and i thought i was priceless...</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin:0;"><strong>recording update:</strong> i have a rough mix of this song i've been working on recording lately up at: <a href="http://www.myspace.com/bluestarmorning" target="_new">www.myspace.com/bluestarmorning</a> ...so feel free to ch-ch-check it out...there's no vocals and i cut it down to just the interesting musical part near the end...and remember...it's just a rough mix...hope to finish up tracking this weekend and get to mixing next week...</p>
<p style="margin:0;"><strong>my new motto for life:</strong> "screw the scene"...i officially am at odds with this so called hipster “scene” that's thriving in and around our area...i despise the cliques and clichés that they start...i hate the superficiality that surrounds it and how it can destroy people...i'm now anti-scene...and i am anti-scene fully knowing that it's very possible to like good, "indie" music and not be apart of said "scene"...it's even possible to dress cool (not that i even remotely do) and not be apart of the scene, believe it or not...</p>
<p style="margin:0;"></p>
<p style="margin:0;">you can do it...and nico-scene can help...</p>
<p style="margin:0;"></p>
<p style="margin:0;">(end random rant)</p>
<p style="margin:0;"></p>
<p style="margin:0;"><strong>in other news</strong> my good friend jenny o. (who has been in south carolina for the past 6 months working with the americorps) slipped and fell off a roof at a house her team was remodeling and really messed up her ankle something good...it's broken in several places and she's going to need a good bit of therapy when the breaks heal up...however, the doctors aren't sure if she'll have full use of her ankle again...but she's definitely lucky that she didn't break more than just her foot from a crazy fall like that...so that's a relief at least...anyways, those of you who know her know she's a pretty active girl and can't stand to just sit around so this is gonna be a hard few months for her...if you could keep her all in your prayers that would be killer...and i'm sure she'd love cards and calls 'n all that...if you need her number or address i've got 'em both...</p>
<p style="margin:0;"></p>
<p style="margin:0;">---</p>
<p style="margin:0;"></p>
<p style="margin:0;">that is all...you may return to your normal lives...</p>
p.s. - by the way, i did say it was going to be a short<em>er </em>post...not necessarily short...short in the context of my xanga site of course...muwahaha...
