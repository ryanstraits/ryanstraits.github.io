listening to : third eye blind - blinded

<!-- break -->

school is "out"...and life is "in"...yes the real world is about to kick me in the butt...i dont' want to go full-time at pro-foam because then my social life will be "out"...however i will then be "in" the money...i had an interview at a prominent local company in a line of work that will be more closely tied to what i went (am goin) to school for which would make me "in" as far as this world is concerned...but it may put me "out" of being able to go and play music at the three camps that i want nothing more than to be able to do this coming summer...so what do i do?...i guess i do nothing...i simply wait for the God who loves me more than anything to let me take a little peek at what he has in store for me...but still my mind implores for answers...are you "in" or are you "out"?

so i'm going movie-crazy lately...saw "x-men 2" last weekend and absolutely loved it (i'm watching a horrible downloaded version of it right now)...this weekend we're going to see "a mighty wind" which promises to be quite enjoyable...and then next week is the perfect sequeway to the summer...the almighty "matrix 2" hits theaters and i am jumping in my construct w/ anticipation to see what i hope to be the best movie (or movies if u count the 3rd one in nov.) of the year...

well tomorrow is the much-feared graduation day...i don't want to go...my mom is making me...not kool...i don't even think they give you the actual degree at graduation...what a sham...

"when i see you...it's like i'm staring down the sun...and i'm blinded..."
