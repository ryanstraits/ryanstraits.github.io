i spent a long time thinking up that title...so yah best be enjoying it, people...in fact...i've been thinking alot lately...and i've decided that i'm not really sure what to think anymore...about much of anything...see i've been branded as an overthinker lately...and the ironic thing about that is...i think i've thought more since being pointed out as one then i did before...

for the past few weeks or so i've been thinking about writing this real serious and thought-provoking post about how strange life can be sometimes...but the thoughts never quite translated themselves into cohesive phrases...that's really been the story behind my recent lapse in xanga entries...see, there is a deeper meaning behind it all, i promise...just like how my last few cell phone bills have been so very telling of my rapidly diminishing social life...april: $197.07, may: $19.57...yes, a full tenth of a difference...

i've been thinking alot about how there's a certain innocence that comes with time...or maybe it's just that sweet bliss that comes with hard-earned ignorance...yes, that's probably more likely...in any case...i think that's what i miss the most...the innocence...i miss being content...i miss the me before all this...

granted, i've learned alot...but now i have a whole new past to forget all over again...a whole new set of sleepless nights and unanswered questions to wrestle with...a fresh new batch of awkward exchanges and that gnawing feeling inside that comes with them...and then there's all the overthinking and anti-thinking and indiscreet late-night xanga entries...it's all so vaguely familiar...

at any rate...i'm pretty sure it's time for a change of direction...and i think i have a few ideas of how to go about doing that...

and i do believe it starts with You...
