it's approximately 42 degrees in my office right now...approximately...

all i know is that i am dying a slow deathÂ to hypothermia...fingers don't click or type as well when they have no blood-flow to them...i'm expected to work in this environment? on the other side of this wall right behind me they are holding our quarterly sales meeting (they're way to often if you ask me)...all our salesmen from all over the country are here...i can hear them talking the company up, boasting at how this final quarter will be better than the rest, trying to explain technical processes and sound like they know what they're talking about, snorting and laughing about their last golf trip to the carolinas, and blowing their hot air all about themselves...they then turn down the thermostat to ungodly levels for all us poor engineering folk who are so fortunate to have our offices right next to them...

last nite i finished up school for this semester...it wasn't as climactic as previous semesters...but it definitely felt good to be done...and maybe for a while too...i'm leaning more and more towards taking the next semester off...not having that extra stress on top of work/etc. would definitely be a welcomed change...

now comes the holidays...i am not ready for them...it's fun to think about all the free time i'm gonna have now that school's done...it's not fun to think about the reality that i'm not really going to have that much free time at all...

sorry about the geeky looking mug to the left...i had to retire kristin...she was tired of having to look amazing for you guys all the time...so you'll just have to deal with a pic of me for a while...

kool things coming soon...
