uhoh...i've fallen back to the dark side...

<!-- break -->

if you've been a long-standing fan of my site (such folk are few and far between i'm sure)...you'll remember that i started my xanga voyage out nearly 2 years ago in utter darkness...since then i've come to the brighter side of things and embraced my inner spiritual lightness...or something like that...now it appears my site has gone black once again...*glances around office to see if anyone's looking*...<em>"back in blaaaaack! i hit the sack...i been too long...but i'm glad to be baaaack!"</em>...uhhhh...yea...ahem...*regains composure*...moving on...

so it's one week until i can officially begin thinking about christmas...i believe i had a big post around this time last year on the insanity of marketing christmas so dang early...so i won't keep beating the dead horse...but i can't take the early commercialism...and i definitely can't listen to christmas songs until after thanksgiving...one holiday at a time please...one holiday at a time...

tonight i believe i'll be heading on another excursion to el canton once again...this will be my 3rd or 4th week in a row...it's beginning to feel like the "deal" days of old that i partook of with my former comrades dave and joe...what good times those were...while the faces have changed (keith and craig being the faithful few lately) and some of the destinations have changed as well...it still has the same feel about it...it's all very nostalgic like and whatnot...so tonight we hope to hit up vdo, maybe best buy, maybe the mall, definitely "ci-ci's pizza", and then "national treasure" at movies 10 as i shall have to write my latest review on it this weekend...good times shall be had i'm sure...

despite accusations suggesting that i'm somewhat narcissistic for re-posting my movie reviews here on my site...*cough*<a href="http://www.xanga.com/kaitrich" target="_blank">kate</a>*cough*...here is a link to my latest review on the quirky and vastly entertaining "<a href="http://www.the-review.com/archive/11112004/PDF/C03.pdf" target="_blank">i heart huckabees</a>" (you'll need adobe acrobat to view the article)...which i regret to inform you is no longer playing in our area...the theaters had to of course make way for that blasted "spongebob" movie and the latest "chucky" installment which i already railed pretty good in my "fall movie preview" earlier in the year so i'll save the rants for now...

have a great weekend ya'll...and check back soon for more tales from the dark side...
