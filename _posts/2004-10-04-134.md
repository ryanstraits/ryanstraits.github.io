<em>i'm in the thick of life...</em>

<!-- break -->

if i haven't made my posts epic events by content...i sure have made them epic by the vast expanses of time that have separated them...yipes...i'm truly sorry you all have had to stare at my random synaptic firings for well over a week now...i have pity on you all for such deplorable reading material...and i don't know if i have a good excuse for not posting...i can't say that i've been too lazy...or that i've been too busy really...maybe i'm just indifferent...maybe this is me breaking from my routine...i definitely haven't been getting online much at home anymore...which i believe to be a good thing...school hasn't been that hard...but it definitely kills my monday and wednesday evenings...and i've really been trying to get out more than i have been on other days...living a little more...dispelling of my "safe" mentality i guess...and i think that's a good thing too...

<strong>the carnival's a-comin' to town</strong>

this past weekend was the world famous, annual swiss festival...and as it does every year, it did not disappoint...i only got the chance to go down one day but definitely had a great time...fri. afternoon my boss asked me to walk down to the fest (it's only 2 blocks away from our plant) with a few other management types...big time stuff...and i ate a stromboli...

and then fri. night...oh the fest was aglow...there was a crispness, a coolness to the slight fall breeze...there were faint whispers in the air...the 'creek was abuzz...oh wait...that could have just been people's responses to a few of our area's latest celebrity-types making a grand appearance at the fest...

while watching the always exciting "steinstossen" (aka large stone throwing) competition with my friends craig, stu and harding...i caught sight of two very giddy girls in my peripheral vision...i glanced over at them...<em>i'd seen them somewhere before</em>...another glance...oh yeeeah...<em>it was coming to me</em>...that's where i've seen them before...

on tv...

it was ruth and miriam from "amish in the city"...<em>suddenly i too found myself getting giddy</em>...i don't quite know why...maybe because i was now like six feet from a pair of quasi-tv stars...oooh how horribly wonderful this was...<em>maybe i should say something to them</em>...i thought...they're like celebrities or something...<em>and then it hit me</em>...hold up...they were alone...no boyfriends...no other friends...<em>they're just here to get attention</em>...cuz dang it...i watched the show...<em>i know all about them now</em>...and i'm pretty sure i have them totally pidgeonholed...and turns out they didn't need my attention anyways...flocks of 13 yr. olds flooded them for autographs...and plenty of old men as well...which was scary in itself...

now if there were cameras hanging over their shoulders...<em>well now hey</em>...that's a whole different story...

and for those of you who watched the show and are wondering....no they haven't gone back to the amish...they were in normal clothes...i'm pretty sure they made that decision even before they went on the show...man i feel so duped...

and have now given them waaaaay too much attention on this xanga...

<strong>in other festival news:</strong> i had a steak sandwich and some fair fries...i also cheered one dave harding to an incredible, come-from-behind victory in the notorious "mouse game"...

<strong>the facts of life</strong>

<strong>fact:</strong> i've started reading "waking the dead" by john eldredge this weekend for the six:forty guys bible study and so far i'm loving it...seems to be right where i'm at in this season of life...coincidence? maybe...(sorry i couldn't resist...that's for you dave)

<strong>fact:</strong> i reeeeeally dig the new rascal flatts cd...if that makes me a hick...then brin' it on ya'll...i ain't skeered...

<strong>fiction:</strong> double negatives ain't no fun...

<strong>fact:</strong> i watched a reprisal of the first two episodes of the new abc series "lost" saturday night and now i'm captivated...blast abc for matching it up in the same timeslot as smallville...what's my poor tivo to do? am i to resort to the ancient device known as a vhs tape? and if so then which one to tivo and which one to tape?!? oh what a quandry i'm in...

<strong>fiction:</strong> the facts listed above are false...
