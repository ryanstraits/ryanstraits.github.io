this isÂ a weekend of concerts for me...last night we saw lovedrug/brazil/brandtson at the grog shop in cleveland...although i would have much rather enjoyed a lovedrug only concert...tonite i'm going to see switchfoot/the elms at ashland university...this should be a good one...hopefully i'll be able to post some reviews or something kool like that here shortly...

well i just realized that i mistyped my email address for my profile...so any of you who have been sending me emails or anything you might wanna resend 'em cuz i did not receive any...

right now i am preparing to be blown away by yet another amazing episode of macgyver...this is too good to be true...
