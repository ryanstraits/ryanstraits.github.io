k...business first...there's my top ten and bottom ten flicks of the year...so check 'em out and let me know if you agree or disagree...my bottom ten basically consisted of the biggest letdowns of the year...in fact, because they were big flops i didn't actually see any of them...shhhh...don't tell...i may catch "troy" at some point, but that's really the only movie on that list that even remotely interests me...

"anchorman" and "napoleon dynamite" nearly made it to my bottom ten list...but anchorman had will ferrell in it (the plot was so horribly stupid though) and napoleon would have made it there simply out of spite...everyone thinks their so dang hip now that they saw it...and cuz it's a supposed "indie" flick...i mean, is it just me or is everyone and their friggin' brother quoting lines from it...all...the...time? hey, i got an idea...go rent a wes anderson film and take in a real "indie" flick and see what the directors were copying when they made napoleon dynamite...

dang where did that come from...oops...sorry...especially to all those of you who thought napoleon dynamite was like the best piece of cinematic brilliance to come out of hollywood in 2004...nope..."garden state" was...now there's one for all you hipsters to check out...if you haven't already...

the new profile pic and banner were taken with my digital camera by yours truly in the mysterious tunnel deep below the detroit international airport on one of our many delays on the way to kc last weekend...what fun...maybe if you're all kool and leave me lots of comments and plead and grovel i'll post a few pics from my kc experience...or maybe not cuz i didn't take that many at all...mostly just these ones in detroit...i need to start taking more photos...i'm really bad with picture-taking consistency i've recently come to find...

but for those wondering...the kc trip was a blast (sans the hours upon hours spent in the detroit and minneapolis airports of course)...and my reasons for saying such are two-fold...one being that it was obvious God was moving through the incredible speakers and as a result you could see him working in all of us in attendance...i'm really excited for what he has in store for six:forty around the bend...i'm sensing many cool things on the horizon...and i'm pumped to just be apart of it...as a result i've been praying like never before and just asking God to use me <em>here</em> where i'm at <em>now</em>...if i'm not making an impact here...then i'm not gonna make much of one anywhere else...i do feel God eventually moving me somewhere else...i don't want to be constrained to just t-county...but i feel that for now...six:forty is where i need to be...and i'm cool with that...i'm cool with ohio for now...but i'd also be thrilled if God so chooses to send me off somewhere else...whether it be stateside or abroad...<em>if not you then...who? if not now then...when?</em>

my second reason for loving the kc trip so much would be just cuz i got to catch up with all my old friends from kc, florida and hot-lanta...and of course i left with a whole group of new friends as well...thanks to scotty, neufeld, the castros, langston, kayla, rothie, chris, and all the others i forgot...you guys definitely made the trip...

i hope to post a "top ten...or fifteen...or twenty cd's of the year" list soon...so be on the lookout for that...until then...here's a smattering of what i'm listening to now:

&nbsp;

<strong>disc's currently rotating in the in-dash six:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>aqualung - still life</li>
	<li>athlete - tourist</li>
	<li>feeder - pushing the senses</li>
	<li>the shore - the shore</li>
	<li>jeremy camp - restored</li>
	<li>anberlin - never take friendship personal</li>
</ul>
