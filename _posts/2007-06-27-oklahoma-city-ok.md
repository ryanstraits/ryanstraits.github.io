so this is gonna be weird talking about the show two days ago and not blogging directly about the events that transpired today in kc...but i guess that'll build anticipation for the entry about today...<br /><br />so we played okc (as the locals call it) on our last tour in the spring and did so with a pretty great local band called "the non"...they're an instrumental group and are young but incredibly talented...we made sure to get a show again with them this time around and they did not disappoint...you all should definitely check them out (if i haven't gushed about them to you already) and get their new cd...i believe it's available off their myspace: <a href="http://www.myspace.com/thenon">www.myspace.com/thenon</a> ...we also are also working on getting a show together with them up in ohio so stay tuned for that...<br /><br />the venue we played at was a place called "convergence" and it's basically a back room in a department store...it's cooler than it sounds, though...the non opened up the show (though they very well could have headlined) and brought their nice, big local following along with them...most everyone stuck around even though there were 4 bands on the bill and the show didn't start til 9pm...twjr played after the non, then state bird and discover america was last...it was a good time but there were a few technical snafu's that didn't get ironed out til discover america's set but all in all the show was a success...<br /><br />rob (who runs convergence) was putting us up at his place once again but on the way over to his house our uhaul trailer decided to take a nice big dump on our luck so far this tour...apparently the leaf spring that supports the axle gave way on one side which in turn caused one of the tires to rub against the wheel well...it wasn't really driveable so we called uhaul (luckily coby and chris got the insurance on it) and they paid to put us up in a hotel for the night...it was also lucky that we were right next to one when it broke down...so we got a nice free hotel stay and got our uhaul fixed first thing the next day...<br /><br />the whole ordeal felt alot like our last time in okc back in march...we had just got on the road heading for kc and our van blew a spark plug and ended up causing a whole heap of trouble for us...we had to rent a van while ours got fixed so that we could play our two shows 5 hours away in kc...we then drove the 10 hour round trip back to okc to pick up our fixed van, return the rental and then head back to kc before making the 12 hour trek back home to ohio the next day...not much fun...we were definitly very fortunate this time around...<br /><br />and then there was kansas city...
