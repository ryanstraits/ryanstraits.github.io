so as we learned in little rock, some bad shows can be partially redeemed by awesome events surrounding the show…in that case it was a sweet place to stay afterwards but in savannah it was just the chance to hang out in the city itself…if you’ve been to savannah before you know what i mean…it’s just a really cool old “deep south” town…a lot of brick streets, old buildings and mossy trees…<br /><br />we only had a 2 hour drive or so from our hotel in florence to savannah so we took off a little earlier than we normally would of so that we could grab some lunch and check out the town…chris had been there a few times before and i had been there once with my family…we wanted to eat somewhere cool and chris knew of this good lil bbq place somewhere in the historical district so we scoured around for a good hour before we finally found it…coby and chris got a rickshaw ride from a guy we met at the bbq place to this huge park that was near where we played at…we all met up there, threw a frisbee around and just generally chilled out for a couple hours til we had to load in for the show…it was a very relaxing afternoon…<br /><br />but it couldn’t make up for the disappointment of our show that night, however…we had all kind of wondered how a show would go over on the evening of july 4th and the obvious answer was: not well…you just can’t compete with fireworks…heck, we all would have rather watched the fireworks than a couple of bands we didn’t know much about…surprisingly, a lot of people showed up for the opening, local band…they were called “unsolved mysteries”…they must have liked the tv show…they were a little different but nice folks…after they were done about 75% of the people there left with them…i’ll omit the exact attendance totals for embarrassment reasons but let’s just say we pretty much played for ourselves…it wasn’t fun but was kind of expected…<br /><br />we’re not sure why the promoter wanted the show on the 4th…we had an off day the 3rd and said we could switch to that day if it would be better but apparently he had something else going that day…he must of also had something going during our show because he took off sometime during it as well… we ended up getting an offer for a place to stay afterwards but opted to just grab some dinner in town and then a hotel on our way to florida…<br /><br />so the show was a letdown but at least it was in an interesting city…
