they're two of the key ingredients needed in keeping a xanga site healthy...and two things which i have lacked an immense amount of lately...but a break in the clouds has made itself evident...so lucky for you all i have decided to put an end to my digital silence and grace you all with my cyber-presence...

the aforementioned wedding madness is out of the way as i prepare to launch into full-out school-attack mode here as the semester ends...it's never a mode that i enjoy...and one that could most likely be avoided by several courses of action including but not limited to: not procrastinating and/or starting to work on research papers further in advance than the week they're due...

but alas...this is the life i've chosen...and i've gotta stick it out...

and that's just scratching the surface, folks...God has also been teaching me an unbelievable amount about himself, my heart, making right choices (and sticking with them) and cliched christian statements...it's been a maddening few weeks to say the least...and sometimes nearly impossible to tell the difference between what God deems the best and what i think is best...what incredible trust it takes to follow him...but what incredible grace he has given to those of us who do...

<strong>a few final notes:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>this united cd hasn't left my cd player for about a month...i'm in awe of how these crazy aussies do worship...and their songwriting on this particular album is top notch...and it's been about the only thing keeping my head above water recently...and did i mention they're really g-dang good?</li>
	<li>God hasn't really been teaching me about cliched christian statements lately...that was just my pitiful attempt at a joke...</li>
	<li>i've joined up with a new musical adventure (i say that purposefully) that will hopefully fare better than any past attempts i've been apart of...it's called state bird...and it promises to be unlike anything you've ever heard (and that was my pitiful attempt at rhyming)...you can all check out a sampling of the insanity <a href="http://www.myspace.com/statebird" target="_new">here</a>...</li>
</ul>
in two weeks i shall be a free man...that is until summer semester...

i'll see yah when i see yah, cyberspace...
