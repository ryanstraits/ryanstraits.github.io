i hate ohio...

i don't just hate it actually...i abhor it...and i utterly despise it's disgusting weather patterns...this saturday is the first day of spring...birds chirping...trees budding...green...warm...you know, spring...whatever that cold, white, slippery crap was that fell last nite, it has no place coming at less than a week before the winter-related activity deadline...if i so much as see one snowflake after march 20th i'm afraid i'll be forced to write my congressman...

anyways, as if this snow doesn't get me enough...sixforty's cancelled now cuz the branch cancelled all classes (of course they cancel once again on a day that i don't have class)...so that's a bit of a bummer...however...it will be nice to have the evening off...cuz as they say "you can never have too much free-time"...well i dunno who says that...but someone should cuz it's true...

so yesterday i came in to work to find out that one of the engineers here at si is resigning and going to another company...seeing as we only have three engineers here (and i'm not even really considered an engineer) it's a pretty big deal...i kinda knew it was coming down...i had actually been called about the job and was being pressured to apply for it...i entertained the idea but turned it down for various reasons...sure would have been fun if i would have applied for it and found out later we were both competing for the same job...God does everything for a reason that's for sure...his last day is march 26th which is conveniently five days before i take off for albania...which could pose a problem...i requested off for the trip several months ago so everything should be good...but as evidenced by the recent events in my bud <a href="http://www.xanga.com/abertroyle" target="_new">troy</a>'s life...the timing of all this is certainly suspect...i believe that it just shows that God is going to do some kool stuff in the lives of us going over...it'd be sweet if you guys could think to pray for us as the weeks wind down...
