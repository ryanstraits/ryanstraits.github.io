i'm sitting here in jackson, mississippi watching the boys from the winston jazz routine sound check before their set...after them we'll go on and then discover america will round things out...we're playing at a pretty swell venue called "swell o' venue"...a very descriptive name if you ask me...<br /><br />last night we played in chatt-town as it's affectionately dubbed by the locals...the jazz boyz played at a joint called "the barking legs theater" which looked pretty cool...discover america and ourselves rocked out a coffee shop called "cafe mi aroma" on the campus of the university of tennesee chattanooga...there was a pretty good turnout and a nice faithful group of chris staples/twothirtyeight fans...i think that kind of weirds him out sometimes but luckily he wasn't in the room when the band following him gushed praises for everything he's ever done...good times...<br /><br />i snapped a few shots of chris/da performing at the cafe and put them up on flickr...there are also a few other random shots from the road as well as some from this sweet local bar we went to after the show called "the pickle barrel"...it was in a flat-iron building of sorts so it kind of just tapered off and was all kinds of rustic and cool inside...then we stayed at the very pimp dwellings of some of nate phillips' family friends just outside of chattanooga...there was ample space for us all to lay our weary heads which is always a plus for a travelling group of 11 people...<br /><br />twjr just got a request to play some skynyrd...we're definitely in the deep south, my friends...<br /><br />later ya'll...
