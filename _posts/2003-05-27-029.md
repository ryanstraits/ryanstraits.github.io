xanga = a faceless escape

<!-- break -->

graduation parties = free wonderful food

season finales = no captivating television until the fall

c.h.g. = pure evil

internet down for 10 hours = frustration

no more pro-foam = elation

new job in one day = anxiety

another summer without you = torture

***

stupid little equations = creative?
