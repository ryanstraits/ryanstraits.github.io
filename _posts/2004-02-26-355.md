<em>can you still feel the butterflies...</em>

for some reason i had a hankerin' to start listening to this cd again...so i popped it into my player last nite and was instantly taken back to high school and the musically formidable years in my life...it was so foundational in developing the kind of music i enjoy even to this day...when i hear ol' jimmy playing on this album i hear hundreds, maybe thousands, of bands out there today that in some way incorporate so many of the elements of what made this cd so amazing into their own music...

why does it feel like everything on my desk here is covered in grease...i feel so disgusting...i really need to stop eating lunch on my desk...however, i have been cutting back on my fast food consumption and have been packing my lunch every other day which is good...every day i look forward to eating my little pear cup and pudding pack...i feel like a schoolboy again...but as for right now i feel like one giant greaseball...which reminds me of one funny, yet totally random thought...<a href="http://www.xanga.com/midstar" target="_new">garry</a> always sliding around on <a href="http://www.xanga.com/dreamerswell" target="_new">dave</a>'s bed when he'd come over and hang out w/ us at the appt. after work at beachy's...haha...oh my...now that's hilarious...i miss those good ol' days...

so speaking of work...yeah well this week wasn't as busy as i previously thought it would be...it's actually quite boring once again...maybe i just need to spice up my life a lil...i think that may require me moving to california...crazy thing is...that's becoming more of a possibility...

speaking of california...i've become increasingly more wrapped up in "the oc"...i'm a dork i know...dang these tv writers...crafting a show that gets me so good...but i've been thinking more about tv shows/movies and what they are exactly and what they do to us...it's crazy once you step back and think about it...they're really nothing more than culturally acceptable and family-friendly drugs...they take us away from reality for varying time intervals and get us high or mixed up in other people's lives...albeit fake people's lives...but they let us forget our own troubles or wallow in the sadness of them and we often experience withdrawal coming off of them when we realize that our lives aren't as great as those of the ones we just watched on the screen...we create false expectations for ourselves and unattainable goals...expectations and goals that are cleverly crafted by writing gurus hidden behind the pearly gates of hollywood...why should they be the ones to tell us what the "good life" is? why are they telling us our dreams, what our goals are, and what expectations we should be living up to? guess i'll just keep watching to find out...

tune in next week...
