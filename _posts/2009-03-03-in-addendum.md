<p>in the interest of promoting beatiful music, i'm going to spread the reach of my previous post a little wider. instead of just friends, i'm including a few loose aquaintances as well:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.myspace.com/perhapsy">perhapsy</a> - i just started listening to this today and am a big fan already. <strong>relation:</strong> i spent a few weeks on the road with derek while he was with the winston jazz routine and i with state bird. </li>
<li><a href="http://www.myspace.com/aaronroche">aaron roche</a> - i'm amazed at the honest and gentle music aaron continues to make. he's a rare find. <strong>relation:</strong> i once spent the night at his house in nashville while on tour. he and his wife were most hospitable.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.myspace.com/brianmilitana">brian militana/fell trees</a> - spellbinding. breathtaking. this album continues to haunt me. <strong>relation:</strong> played on the same bill at a show in nashville. that night, <a href="http://perhapsymusic.blogspot.com/2009/01/seeing-is-believing-brian-militanafell.html">derek</a> nailed it when he asked: "is this what it [felt] like to see Johnny Cash for the first time?"</li>
<li><a href="http://www.myspace.com/thenonband">the non</a> - i have pimped these guys non-stop (heh!) ever since i first heard them. <strong>relation:</strong> played a show together with them in their hometown of oklahoma city.</li>
</ul>
<p>in response to this cascade of inspiration, i began digging out my recording gear from it's winter hibernation this past weekend. one of the main reasons for getting my own place was so that i could dedicate more time to writing and recording. i'm 1/6th of the way through 2009 and i have nothing to show for it so far. this is not good progress. i hope to make up for it in the month of march.</p>
<p>i'm even thinking about cancelling my cable. now, that's dedication.</p>
