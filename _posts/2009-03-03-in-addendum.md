In the interest of promoting beautiful music, I'm going to spread the reach of my previous post a little wider. Instead of just friends, I'm including a few loose acquaintances as well:

+ <a href="http://www.myspace.com/perhapsy" target="_blank">Perhapsy</a> - I just started listening to this today and am a big fan already. **Relation:** I spent a few weeks on the road with Derek while he was with the Winston Jazz Routine and I with State Bird.

+ <a href="http://www.myspace.com/aaronroche" target="_blank">Aaron Roche</a> - I'm amazed at the honest and gentle music Aaron continues to make. He's a rare find. **Relation:** I once spent the night at his house in Nashville while on tour. He and his wife were most hospitable.

+ <a href="http://www.myspace.com/brianmilitana" target="_blank">Brian Militana/Fell Trees</a> - Spellbinding. Breathtaking. This album continues to haunt me. **Relation:** Played on the same bill at a show in Nashville. That night, <a href="http://perhapsymusic.blogspot.com/2009/01/seeing-is-believing-brian-militanafell.html" target="_blank">Derek</a> nailed it when he asked: "Is this what it [felt] like to see Johnny Cash for the first time?"

+ <a href="http://www.myspace.com/thenonband" target="_blank">The Non</a> - I have pimped these guys non-stop (heh!) ever since I first heard them. **Relation:** Played a show together with them in their hometown of Oklahoma City.

In response to this cascade of inspiration, I began digging out my recording gear from it's winter hibernation this past weekend. One of the main reasons for getting my own place was so that i could dedicate more time to writing and recording. I'm 1/6th of the way through 2009 and I have nothing to show for it so far. This is not good progress. I hope to make up for it in the month of march.

I'm even thinking about cancelling my cable. Now that's dedication.
