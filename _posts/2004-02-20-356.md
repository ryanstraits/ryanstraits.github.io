<em>back down the bully to the back of the bus...cuz it's time for them to be scared of us...</em>

bring on the weekend...i am ready for quasi-sleeping in tomorrow and sunday...i say quasi because i still have to set my alarm to be up for a specific time...i do not believe that actually qualifies as sleeping in...i have to be up and in new phila tomorrow by 9:40 for the "12 ordinary men" study i am particpating in w/ cam and...you guessed it...11 other guys...and then sunday i will have to be up to be at church by 10:30...not too bad...i am greatly anticpating keeping my eyelids closed until the last possible moment i can...

this has been one of the most boring days i've had at work in a very long time...i think mostly because i've been steadily busy w/ new projects up until today...i usually complete around 30 projects a month...so far this month i've completed about 37 and it's only the 20th...and this is even a short month...pretty crazy...i'm not sure what the influx of work should be credited to...maybe it's because production is slow right now so everyone is getting out all their "only do when production is slow" type projects, giving them to me and then proceeding to leave work early...hmmm...i may need to investigate...next week is already shaping up to be one heck of a crazy week at work...dick our engineering manager will be out of the office all week so i am going to be getting alot of work that i usually wouldn't do and will obviously be way above my head...so i guess i should view today as a nice break inbetween being insanely busy...hmmm...nope...still boring...

tonite i will most likely engross myself once again in the world enclosed inside my xbox...that wretched world that tempts me ever so masterfully...

i hear it's sposed to be beautiful out this weekend...

let's see if i make it out...
