lots of kool stuff going on with me...first off i ended up buying that ampeg bass amp off ebay for more than $100 cheaper than it was at guitar center...it should be here by tomorrow...i can hardly contain my excitement...i also got my new cell phone last week...it's really nice and has a lot of fun gadgets and gizmos for me to pass the time with...hooray for that...

in other news, the six:forty worship team is getting some much needed time off these next few weeks and it couldn't have come at a better time...school is getting out of hand and i am finding myself not being able to catch up...it's getting very frustrating...i have pretty much come to the conclusion that i will probly take the next semester off of school...i may end up taking forever off of school...i do not know at this time...i do know that it is demanding alot of my time and i hate giving so much time and brainpower to something that i am not totally convinced is that profitable...we shall surely see i guess...tues. nite i hung out w/ cam after six:forty and shared my heart w/ him on everything that's been going on in my little world...it was very encouraging and has given me hope for so many things that are yet to come...one other tidbit...for those of you who haven't read "the purpose-driven life" yet, i highly recommend you do so, i would have added it to my last post as something that i like that you should like too, but i forgot...anyways, this book is superb and rick warren is a master of the practical...i am learning basic truths and getting little handles to live my life by, i'm also beginning to think about God and myself in a way that i never have before...and that's most definitely a good thing...

so tues. i went to wal-mart in search of bleach's newest disc only to find it not there...ever since wally world totally rearranged their electronic entertainment section their christian album selection has been seriously lacking...they used to really be on top of things by offering most of the cd's you'd find in a christian bookstore but at a fraction of the price...now i can't find anything and the christian section is shrinking...but i did get 3 amazing cd's from the $9 rack...that's right, i got both coldplay cd's and radiohead - ok computer for only $9 a piece...so everyone needs to go there and buy them now...those should be 3 foundational cd's in any music lover's collection...so i guess i can go ahead and forgive wal-mart now...
