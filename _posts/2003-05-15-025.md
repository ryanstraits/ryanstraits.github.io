i saw an early screening of "the matrix: reloaded" last nite and it was absolutely phenomenal...early reports had indicated that i should be prepared for a disappointment and while the whole mystery of the matrix wasn't as strong and captivating as the first one, the spectacular special effects and new spins on the storyline and characters more than made up for any pitfalls in the plot...i will be seeing it again very soon...

<!-- break -->

not too soon though as i will probably be working all the rest of this week...while i am being interviewed for a new job (i had my 3rd and final interview on wed...it's between me and one other person...i'll know if i have it by week's end), reality has hit me today and reluctantly i must still report to my dull, factory job later this afternoon...the weekend can not come any sooner...

it has now become apparent that two very different paths lay before me...similar paths in their means and the change they will make in my life...but different in how they will most likely end and how they will each shape my future...neither has made themselves known as the <strong>right</strong> choice...i can only hope i make the <strong>best</strong> choice as i revel in the fact that i have a choice in the matter at all...

oh the possibilties of the coming summer...
