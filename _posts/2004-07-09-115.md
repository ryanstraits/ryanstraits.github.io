lately i've been seeking to find something to breath new life into my currently dismal record playing device...you know...with that one band (or artist) that makes you love music again...those songs that just seem to strike a chord in your soul somehow...i've searched high and low hoping to find something to make my ears perk up and take heed like they did so long ago...well...i think i may have just happened upon that band...they go by the name "letter kills" and their new cd is called "the bridge"...they just seem to have the right combination of all that i find good in music currently...a great lead singer nearly screaming melodies over driving rhythms...soaring metal-esque leads...a whole load of gang vocals...anthematic slow songs placed in just the right spots...it's just good stuff...now i'm not going to say the coined phrase "go out and support these guys and get their cd"...because well...i just downloaded it and would feel bad telling you that especially when their album isn't even out yet...but if you get the chance to check them out...i would most certainly advise it...

<!-- break -->

ok so now as i promised...here are some pictures of my much-talked-about trip to cali-forn-i-a...sorry if they're somewhat of a letdown given how highly i praised the trip...they'll just have to do folks...i'm only one man...i only have one camera...and i only had 2 rolls of film...now at least you'll all know that i was really there...
