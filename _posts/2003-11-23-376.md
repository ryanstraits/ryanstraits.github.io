<i>"i want love...if love wants me"</i>

i'm writing in between renderings for my computer animation project...it's in a program called 3d studio max if any of you have heard of it...anyways, i'm adding a bunch of neato effects and it's taking forever to render the scene so i thought i'd be kool and post an entry while i'm waiting...

ok so what's the deal? thanksgiving isn't even here and already they're pushing christmas on us...hey corporate america, can i enjoy one holiday at a time please? every year the christmas rush starts earlier and earlier...our kids may truly know the meaning of the phrase "christmas in july" because that is when society will be telling them to start buying their presents...geesh people...get a grip...it's thanksgiving...time for turkeys, pilgrims and that disgusting cranberry stuff...can't i just appreciate the fact that it's thanksgiving and not have to start worrying about christmas already?...they might as well just combine the two holidays and just make it a national day of giving thanks that both jesus and the pilgrims came because look at how good we're doing of living by the principles they lived (and died) for...

not that exciting of a weekend...but not half bad either...friday nite we went up to vdo and then saw "pirates of the caribbean" at the dollar theater...a pretty good movie...specially if you're in the mood for some swashbucklin' fun...i wasn't particularly in that mood but hey it was only $1.50...one great moment in the film came near the end when all the good pirates were yelling "hazaaa!" when they beat the bad pirates...at first listen i thought they were saying "kazaa!" which would make sense because if you use kazaa you're a pirate...well, i thought it was funny...

almost done w/ this project...thank goodness...next i think i'm going to watch one of the new dvd's i got for my b-day...the bourne identity, the sixth sense or office space...hmmm...

geesh waiting for this to render is like watching paint dry...

...i can't wait for break
