my deepest apologies for what appears to be the stalest xanga site this side of myspace...

yea and i don't update that one either...

i do hope to freshen up this site a bit here in the very near future...maybe as soon as this weekend...maybe that will inspire me to get on a regular updating schedule...but the truth is honestly there is not much to update on...i've been racking my brain...really, i have...and this is what you get...a whole entry about how i can't write any interesting entries...pretty great, right...

well, i guess i'll humor you all with what's been shaking down lately...spring semester started yesterday...kinda funny because it was actually 50 degrees on tuesday...and really felt like a warm, rainy spring day...but then today came...and it was 30 again...yup...it's ohio, baby...and we love and/or hate her for it...

kind of like school...i love the fact that i'm only 16 credit hours away from finishing (9 after this semester) and will be applying for december graduation here shortly...but hate it that i'm indeed <em>still </em>in school and so seemingly far away from it's greatly anticipated end...

i'm also despising that i've been working a whole lot of overtime...10 hour days here lately...and i even worked last saturday...that's right...i desecrated the all-american holy day...but alas...i now have deadlines and projects and papers and lines and circles to complete...and on top of all that...*gasp*...i have responsibilities there...

when did that happen?...but i guess i love that i get paid time and a half for my blasphemous ways...but now that i've broken that threshold...i don't know if i can ever go back...i think all of you well on your way up the corporate ladder know what i mean..."it just never seems to end..."

and would you look at that...i may have just salvaged this post...let's just hope i can do the same with this dreadful site...
