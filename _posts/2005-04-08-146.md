<em>i looked up at the sun and i could see...the way the gravity turns for you and me...</em>

ahh the sun...the good ol' boy's been peakin' his head out quite a bit lately...spreadin' some golden love down on all of us cold and lonely ohioans...it really is crazy how much these sunny and seasonable days affect my mood...maybe i only get this way during these restless spring months...when the possibilities of the coming summer invade my mind and when the reality that winter is finally dying grabs hold...and the sun breaks through...warms the air...and as a result warms me all good 'n toasty on the inside...

yes, the weather has finally been good to me...and so has life really...it's not often i post about life being good...and that's a shame...it really is...i'm too down on my life i've come to realize...i mean i need to keep challenging myself not to settle for this all-too-easy mediocre life that's so prevalent around here...but i've been realizing that i need to be content with where i am...take what i've been given and where i'm at...cuz when i look at who i am and where i used to be...i'm thankful...

God has been good to me...

i was just thinking the other day...about when i was in school and how i projected my life to be about this far in the future...i'm now five years outta high school...and i'm far beyond where i thought i'd be right about now...i'm grateful for that...i have a great job...and i have some very cool opportunities afforded to me...i'm leading worship...which i never thought in a million years i'd be doing...i'm making and recording music on my own...and i'm getting more involved with film-making in various forms...two things that were merely insane notions a few years back in my mind...

my, how life has changed...it's these days that i'm happy to be alive...when life starts to feel like a movie again...a particularly well-scripted movie on a warm summer night...a movie that i'm just loving being apart of...and a movie that i'm sure will end just beautifully...
