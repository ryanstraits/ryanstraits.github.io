<span style="font-family:Verdana;">it's monday...back to work i go...it's not fun getting used to a new schedule especially when your body's sleep schedule is still about 3 hours behind...and thanks to some people i haven't been getting to bed at a decent time lately...oh well...soon enough i'll be popping out of bed at 6:30 and feeling great...</span>
