ok...i'd apologize for the rather lengthy spans of time in between my posts...but then that'd be a lil redundant now wouldn't it?

so i've been involved in some rather clandestine activities lately...or should i say i've been a little <em>furtive</em> while observing some purported clandestine activities...yea that sounds about right...see, i've been doing some undercover spy work...and i've just now been given clearance...well i mean...i'm finally letting myself reveal my findings for you all to see...

see for many years now there have been murmurings of a so-called "amish mafia" doing business in and around this wonderful world we know as amish country...being on the rogue and outlying regions of amish-land i figured there was no real threat of their presence here...well boy have i been proven wrong...

for the past several months i've been monitoring a rather suspicious operation going on here in sugarcreek...i haven't quite clued in on what it is exactly or why it's here...but whatever is going on seems to be shrouded in secrecy...there's an odd-looking, out-of-place block building directly behind the bulk food store next to the plant in which i work...i frequent the bulk store often for lunch and i park very close to this strange building everyday...so i've taken note of a few of the peculiar characteristics that surround it...here are just a few: there's always a "maranatha christian school" bus parked there...along with a few suburbans...and of course the usual bevy of buggies...but that's not the kicker...here's the thing...the building is about oh...20' x 50' i'd say with only one door and no windows...<em>one door and no windows</em>...the door has a keycode pad right next to it...<em>a keypad required for entry</em>...your everyday, run-of-the-mill amish know not of such things...there's something deeper...<em>something darker</em> at work here...and finally, there's a red light above the door...like a flashing red light that would probly go off in the case of a security breach or something...yea how many amish businesses are there that you know of that have a security system...

now, i don't think i'm the only one here who would agree that there is some amish mafia involvement afoot here...i mean think about it...the amish have this supposed peaceful, idyllic existence here in rural ohio...it's the perfect front for mafia dealings...well i'll tell yah...this is one man who is not fooled by it...i'm on to 'em...it's a conspiracy i tell yah...the buggies...the hats...dropping out of school after the 8th grade...their horses crappin' all over the roads...there's something fishy going on...and i'm on to it...

finally, to prove this mysterious building's existence i have taken several pictures of it for documentation purposes with my spy camera that also doubles as a cell phone...tricky, i know...so here they are for your viewing amazement:

so in review, let's run down the list of all this unusual activity once again:
<ul>
	<li>a small block building placed in a very pecular location</li>
	<li>said building has no windows and only one door</li>
	<li>said door has a keypad required for entrance</li>
	<li>and there's most likely a security system involved</li>
</ul>
you are now a witness...the truth is out there...

how very coincidental that this word just so happened to pop into my head this morning...it sums up the content of this entry quite nicely now doesn't it?...

hmmm...coincidental indeed...

off the subject but relevant to the upcoming weekend...if you're in the mood for a decent flick in this rather dismal month at the theaters...i'd suggest "in good company"...but do make sure you read <a href="http://www.the-review.com/archive/01272005/PDF/C03.pdf" target="_new">my review</a> first...
