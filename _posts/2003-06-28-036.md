so it's the weekend...and it couldn't be received more warmly by me...saturdays will never be overrated...right now they are the only day i can catch up on all the sleep i lose during the week...and for that they will always hold a special place in my heart...

<!-- break -->

last nite i went with a whole lot of my friends to see "the italian job"...since it's been out a few weeks there was barely anyone else in the theatre so we got to talk and be generally obnoxious which made the movie that much more enjoyable...by the end everyone was jumping for joy praising me for making such a fine movie choice...yippee for that...

today i am going to be consumed with outdoor activities...mowing the lawn, washing my car...you know "real work" as opposed to the lame excuse i call work during the week...

just found out today that i may be playing in an ensemble of different musicians this sat. nite at the first town days festival...i hear that if we do good they may consider letting us play for 2nd town days and possibly even 3rd town days...how thrilling...

before i go...i'd just like to say that last nite i fiddled around with my recording equipment in the basement and i should be primed and ready to start writing/recording music as soon as i head to the music store and pick up a few things...this makes me very excited now that i have the momentum going...hopefully only good things will come out of it...

now if i could just get off this computer...
