listenin' to: u2 - with or without you

<!-- break -->

so my latest obsession is playing tecmo super bowl on nintendo...i used to actually own a nintendo until my mom sold it in a garage sale without my consent for around 35 cents...i was a happy camper that day...however today we have computers and no need for bulky nes systems...we can just download all the games and emulators onto our computers...how sleek...so i chat a little...play a little nintendo...listen to some music...play a little nintendo...good fun all the way around...so i just completed a season w/ my homies the los angeles raiders (not the oakland raiders for all you critics out there...remember this was 1991)...and we kicked butt takin' the super bowl by storm (bo knows football)...i just recently started a season w/ the kansas city chiefs and we are doing quite well...

my friend aaron is equally as obsessed w/ super mario 3 and has beat it a total of like 3 times this weekend...last nite he stayed up until 3am beating the game world by world...yup that's without using any whistles...insane...

so i guess there has been a debate over xanga journals/trendiness/conformity/etc. lately...i have only this to say: there is no such thing as a nonconformist...if you're not conforming to trends then you're conforming to something else...YOU WILL ALWAYS BE CONFORMING TO SOMETHING...and for all your christian kids out there...we have been called to conform to the image of the lord jesus christ...i think that's a trend worth striving for...
