<em>amazing still it seems...i'll be 23...</em>

another year...another number beside my name...

<!-- break -->

here it is...the obligatory birthday post...seems like birthdays for me lately have been pretty overrated though...i mean, there are no more "noteworthy" birthdays left for me to look forward to...no more 16's, 18's, or 21's...that is unless you count 25...the year i can legally drive a rental car and the supposed time my insurance drops dramatically...although given my slightly varied record i highly doubt that'll come to fruition...

big events in my life will not be determined according to year and date anymore...they'll be determined by the people i am associated with...the people i love...now i have wedding days, the birth of children, first steps taken, etc. to look forward to...and that my friends is downright madness...

so anyways...here i am...a year older than i was yesterday...but most importantly...a year older than i was last year...i feel like i've changed so much since i turned 22...it'd be too hard to explain on here...but from my spiritual side to my geographical side i feel like God is moving more and more in my life...it's a scary place to be...but it's right where he wants me...i feel on the verge of something...something bigger than meaningless days that we ascribe our humanly importance...

what a dreary day for my birthday though...30's and mostly overcast with a few spots of sunshine...

but that's about how it should be i guess...cuz that's where i'm at...

there's greatness about to break through...

<em>you'll sit alone forever...if you wait for the right time...
what are you hoping for?...i'm here...i'm now...i'm ready...holding on tight...don't give away the end...
the one thing that stays mine...</em>

p.s. - i do wanna thank those of you have went out of their way to make me feel special today...namely jonie, sara and a few others (mostly girls actually...we guys pretty much suck at this sorta thing)...you girls took what would otherwise be a mundane monday and made it that much better...i appreciate it...
