i'm going to combine the tuscaloosa and little rock entries to save myself a little time...we've been doing alot of travelling the past two days and i haven't had that much time to get on and post...and to be honest, there wasn't a whole lot concerning these two shows to write home about...<br /><br />there were many positives about both shows but a whole lot of negatives to go along with them...we played at a relatively small, modern christian coffeehouse in tuscaloosa called "the pour cafe"...there was a decent turnout but the sound wasn't that great and got us a little frustrated...though we did take a few funny pictures afterwards with some vacation bible school props that you all can see on the flickr site...<br /><br />we then got to hang with the really cool folks that put on the show...their names were buddy and haily and they showed us as good of a time as i'm sure you can have in alabama...we stayed the night at buddy's very hip loft apartment in downtown tuscaloosa...it seemed way out of place in alabama...i was going to snap some pics of it but didn't get a chance as we had to ship out pretty quick in the morning for our 6 hour or so drive to little rock...<br /><br />we were a little nervous about the show in little rock, arkansas as it was going to be at another christian coffeehouse called "the rhythm &amp; brews" and we don't usually fit in well at those venues...this one wasn't much different but once again the night was redeemed by a terrific place to stay...<br /><br />we ended up getting to the venue a little late and we could tell they were already a little peeved at us for that...there were alot of bands/groups on the bill for that night and our styles didn't really mesh up well with any of them except for maybe one other band called "garage voice"...they're from seattle and were super nice guys so that was a bonus...<br /><br />we then took off for the place we scored to stay at...we didn't quite know what to expect but our expectations were definitely exceded...it was by far the nicest place we've stayed at all tour...it was the home of a very nice family who had plenty of rooms w/ beds, showers and even a heated swimming pool...and when i say this house was nice, i mean it was "mtv cribs" nice...paige (the matriarch in this fine family) showed us that the best part of little rock was definitely at their house...<br /><br />they had donuts waiting for us when we woke up and packed a cooler full of cold beverages for our trip to denton, tx today...bands like us are very grateful for families like the jenkin's who know how to make us feel like a million bucks...if you ever want to know how to treat a band right, i'm sure they could teach you a lesson or two...<br /><br />so tonight we're at this really cool bar/club here in denton, tx called "hailey's"...it was set up by our good friend dustin and promises to be a great show...but that's about all i can fit in to this entry for these two little shows...i'm sure these next two texas shows are going to require texas-sized posts to cover them, though...<br /><br />tune in next time...
