<em>i'm dead as dead can be...my doctor tells me...</em>

<strong><span style="color:#009999;">a note on the featured song:</span></strong> i've never been a fan of "a perfect circle"...at all really...but i heard this song and it nearly changed my mind about them...that is if the rest of the album it's on wasn't filled with tired and redundant political rants that sound like they're straight out of the seventies (a couple of them actually are covers of seventies songs)...but this is nothing new of course...everyone thinks green day is the savior of modern rock cuz they're 40 now and finally putting out a cd that's grammy worthy...does anyone happen to remember that they were popular in the early 90's? and they're just now getting critical praise 20 albums later?...and really only because they're bashing the government...well there's a real original stance for a punk band to take...i've never heard of anyone doing that before...

anyhow...all that to say..."passive" is a pretty great song...you can currently hear it on the recent commercials for constantine...looks like it will be a good fit with the movie...which i should be reviewing this weekend...if all goes according to plan that is...

<em>but i just can't believe him...ever the optomistic one...</em>
