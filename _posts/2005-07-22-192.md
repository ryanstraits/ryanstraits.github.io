you know...it's pretty sad when you're home on a friday night and your parents are the ones throwing a big party upstairs...

<!-- break -->

but alas i have a much larger accomplishment for this evening...one that will likely rank at the top of my narrow list of truly fulfilling achievements...

i have finally beaten <em>halo</em>...

no, not the 2nd one...the <em>original</em>...i know i'm several years behind on this...but that's the way i am with these things...especially video games...why play madden 2005 when you can play madden 2004 i say?...

but tonight another notch to my gaming belt has been added...yes indeed...i came...i played...i utterly annihilated my foes...and i did it all by <em>myself</em>...(except for that one night that tyler helped me out on that one hard level...but yea...by myself)...

and you may be thinking...wow, he must have beat it on <em>legendary</em>...the hardest of difficulty settings...but to that i would say no...i did not...i beat it on <em>easy</em>...

i'm no glutton for punishment...

i'm also not one for resting on my laurels...so i should prove responsible now and salvage some of this evening by doing some homework...but then again...i think i'm going to go watch a movie...

to the <em>victor</em> go the spoils...
