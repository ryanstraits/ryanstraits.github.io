so...i didn't get a chance to enter anotherÂ chapter into the ongoing chronicle of my trip to albania...i deeply apologize and i hope to bring you part 4 sometime this weekend and at the very latest monday...i know you are all on the edge of your seats so i hate to keep you waiting...

in the meantime i hope you enjoy the new site design...the banner picture is not a stock photo but one i took while in new york city...i believe it's a neighborhood on the east side or someplace trendy like that...

have a grand(e) weekend...
