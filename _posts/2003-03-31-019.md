only in ohio: 70 degrees on friday, 25 degrees and snow by monday...on my way to school i think i passed like 8-9 wrecks...no joke...old man winter caught everyone by surprise...just when we thought he's gone for the summer he plays a little april fools joke on us all...well at least it was warm over my spring break...and what a break it was...very calm and refreshing...my parents were in san diego...my sisters were still in school and we got a brand new computer on wed...quite relaxing i must say...

<!-- break -->

i did have to work this whole weekend which was kinda a drag...but things are going pretty good w/ the new job...it's hard work and just about everything i touch afterwards gets covered w/ a thin layer of "foam dust"...but i'm gettin by...however josh is now getting moved to midnights starting this week...it's gonna be better for him because now he'll have some semblance of a life...so that's nice...

this weekend is the los salvadores concert...well actually the band's name is just salvador but i like to think of as many ways i can exaggerate their name as possible...just cuz spanish is a fun language to exaggerate...anyways...the six:forty p&amp;w team is opening up for them and i'm apart of that team so i hope it will be kool...i have never heard this el saliviador band...but i hear they are very entertaining...and what better on a friday nite than some good ol' entertainin'? so everyone come and check it out...and if your prejudice against hispanics (or hispanic sounding bands) just come and see us play and then leave...
