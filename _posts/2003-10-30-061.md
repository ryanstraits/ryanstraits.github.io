hip hip hooray...i just received another fun gadget in the mail yesterday...as a result of signing up at the right time for the training i had to take for work in cleveland last month they gave me a free portable mp3 player...how fun...it can hold up to 256MB (or in non-geek speak about 4-5 full albums) and can also hold non-music files which means it can be used as a removable disc drive as well...how nifty...

<!-- break -->

one of the albums i now have on my mp3 player and in the cd player in my car is the new coldplay live cd...while i'd much rather they be putting out a brand new cd sometime soon this live cd will most definitely suffice...i suggest everyone go buy it, as i will be, when it comes out along w/ a live dvd next tues. nov. 4th...

in related news: inspired by coldplay frontman chris martin, i began growing a beard once again hoping to get compared to him like i did in days of yore...it hasn't happened yet, but the other day someone did say i looked like justin timberlake...it's no chris comparison...but it'll do i guess...

so i tied all my previous topics together but alas, my continuity has run out...man my entries haven't been quite up to par lately and i greatly apologize...for some reason all my wit and candor has run out...i hope it returns soon...for your sake and mine...

lastly, my good buddy troy has jumped on the xanga bandwagon and got himself a journal...you can check it out <a href="http://www.xanga.com/abertroyle" target="_target">here</a>...make sure you give him some encouraging, "welcome to the family"-like comments...

good day xanga-bandwagians...

p.s.- i used the phrase "days of yore" in my post...please pray for me...
