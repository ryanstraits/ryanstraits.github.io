what an incredible God i serve...i am constantly amazed and dumbfounded at his increasing faithfulness and grace to such a one as myself...daily i feel as if i drive His holy name into the dirt but he continues to hold fast to His promises and reaches down, picks me back up and dusts me off everytime, no matter how many times i may fall...You and only You, oh Lord, are worthy of my praise...

what a cool week it's been...this past weekend i enjoyed showing a bunch of festival "newbies" the wonderful world that is the swiss festival...although it just isn't the same without all my old friends that just seemed to make the festival that much greater...

last nite was six:forty's first night at our new location: the old office max building in new towne mall...we christened our first nite there by having the amazingly entertaining <a href="http://www.isaacimprov.com" target="_new">isaac improv</a> perform...they were absolutely hilarious...i haven't laughed that hard in a long time...my good bud <a href="http://www.xanga.com/averagejoe" target="_new">joe</a> is in isaac and it was great watching him perform...he is by far the funniest man i know and definitely lived up to that status last nite...i hope to see them again soon...i had a good long talk after the show with isaac's "improvising" musician man (he plays music for the scenes they're doing)...his name is ben and he's from san diego and he's a kool guy...he's also in a band down there that is looking for a new bass player...i'm definitely open to wherever God is leading me to go in life...especially if it's to san diego, cali...ben wants me to audition for the band...oooh buddy...it's very, very tempting...but like i said i'm open to wherever God wants me...wherever...it can be anywhere out of ohio and that would be fine...like even san diego for instance...yeah, ok i think God's got it by now...

this week is just not gonna let up from here on out...i'm not gonna have one night off the rest of the week...it's getting increasingly hard to balance work/school/six:forty responsibilites...as of late school has been getting shoved to the bottom of the priority list and while it is the least important thing (in my mind) in my life right now...it's one of the most time demanding...and come end of the semester i may be near suicide...

speaking of suicide...my sister and i started running in the mornings before i go to work...yup i'm a runner now...but we've only ran one day so far and my legs are already calling it quits...not a good sign...but a sure sign that i am indeed out of shape...

until we meet again great denizens of xangapolis...
