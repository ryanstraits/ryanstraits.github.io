so ohio got smart and listened up...good goin...you've made the first step toward recovery...realizing there is a problem...maybe now you can be institutionalized, reformed and changed for the better...we've yet to see what you can do, ohio...just know that i believe in you...but you've got to be moronic to think i'm gonna live inside your God-forsaken borders for the rest of my life...

<!-- break -->

last nite felt like a typical summer nite...nearly 70 degrees...i put my sunroof up...i listened to my music loud...and it felt good...troy and i ventured to the northen wonderland of canton and fulfilled our material desires at vdo and a new-fangled contraption called "the mall"...some of you may have heard of it...anyways...i firmly believe now that the longer i stay away from the village...the more stuff i find the next time i go there...it's like all the great clothes i find there are just accumulating and waiting for me the next time i visit...so i'll be frequenting vdo in quarterly increments from here on out...

today i'm taking a half day here at work and heading down to columbus to spend the weekend with my dad at the boys high school state basketball tournaments...always makes for a good time...this year we have louge seats which i'm particularly excited about...the tournaments are a tradition for me and my dad and an excuse for us to thoroughly embrace our inner alpha-male's and jump, root and holler at a bunch of high school kids bouncing a rubber ball around...

today: columbus...

next wednesday: the world....
