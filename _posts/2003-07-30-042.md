girls are deep
and they are filled with things
that boys will never figure out

boys are weak
they carve out holes too steep
and making up means
digging themselves out

the paragraph above is a song i am currently writing...it's my cheap attempt at being witty...and for those of you who don't think it's witty at all...well tough that's all you're getting...

this week is off to a rather drab start...i hate "normal" weeks...i hate "normal" days...i hate "normal"...but that's all i'm getting these days and it makes me sick...next week, however, i am going to be leading worship at another camp...a chance to escape from the "normal" and get out and do something different for a change...something that means something...something that will make an impact for eternity...this time i am actually going to be leading (as in the guy who has to talk in-between songs n stuff) and it's not exactly in my comfort zone...that's a good thing though...because the less i can say through my own power up there the more God can say through me and that's when kool things start happening...

anyways...this time the camp is in michigan...we leave sunday afternoon and we'll be gone til next sat. or so...if yah would like to pray for the six:forty worship team while we're gone we'd much appreciate it...

one more thing...ok so the hugh jackman comments are getting a little old but i'll tell you one compliment that i have gotten that will never get old...while i was at the camp in KC a man approached a rather bearded-looking me and said that i look like the singer in coldplay...now that's a compliment i can really enjoy...if i would have died at that very moment i could have said afterwards that i had truly lived...

camp pics from KC for anyone who 's interested:
