<span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-size:large;"><span style="font-size:small;"><span style="color:#6699cc;"><strong>ryan's summer movie preview
</strong><span style="font-size:xx-small;">(aka - movies that ryan is currently looking forward to seeing this summer)*</span></span></span></span></span>
<ol>
	<li><strong>the day after tomorrow</strong> - yeah yeah...it's the end of the world again...but hey al gore says this is the way it could really happen...and when the inventor of the internet speaks...you listen...</li>
	<li><strong>around the world in 80 days</strong> - ok, so i don't know what looks so appealing to me about jackie chan flying around the world in a balloon back in the 19th century...but it does...and i heard the wilson bro's have a cameo in it...that's worth the ticket price alone...</li>
	<li><strong>the terminal</strong> - tom hanks stuck in an airport with an outrageous accent...i dunno...it looks quirky...and it's spielberg...</li>
	<li><strong>spiderman 2</strong> - i'm not really overly excited about this one really...i'll probly catch it (definitely not on opening night) though...gotta keep up with the mythology because there will be sequels i'm sure...plus what other huge epic blockbusters do we have to look forward to now that the matrix and lotr movies have all been released? well there's episode 3 next may...but that's just too far away...</li>
	<li><strong>king arthur</strong> - it's no "first knight" and clive owen is no sean connery...but they say this is probably closer to the real story...pfffhht...there will be no other lancelot for me than richard gere...i can't accept it...</li>
	<li><strong>anchorman</strong> - this is probably my most anticipated movie this summer...ever since i saw the trailer for it a few months back i haven't been able to hold in my excitement...it looks so incredibly funny...the character that will ferrell plays in this looks like every snl character he ever portrayed all rolled up into one...this is gonna be great...</li>
	<li><strong>i, robot</strong> - will smith vs. the robots...i gotta see what they do with this one...</li>
	<li><strong>the bourne supremacy</strong> - the first movie was pretty good...it definitely wasn't mission: impossible (note to self: m:i-3 comes out next summer...) but it was good...and it's been a while since i've see a good government/spy/action flick of sorts...so this one makes the list...</li>
	<li><strong>the manchurian candidate</strong> - ok, so the only reason this one made the list is because our waiter at the bubba gump shrimp company in times square is an extra in it and he claims he's easily viewable in a few scenes...only two problems face me at this point...i forget which scenes he told me he was in and can't for the life of me remember what he looks like...</li>
	<li><strong>the village</strong> - it's m. night shyamalan...what can i say...i really dig his movies...and second to anchorman, this is probably my next most anticipated movie this summer...i haven't seen a good thriller/suspense/mystery movie in a real long time...let's pray he doesn't let me down...</li>
</ol>
*ranked by release date (not by how much i'm looking forward to them)

<strong>notable mention:</strong>
<ul>
	<li><strong>harry potter 3 -</strong> well i may have been looking forward to this one but i haven't seen the 2nd one yet...i know i need to...and i really want to...i just haven't...don't crucify me potter fans...just throw me a few bucks for a rental and i promise i'll watch it...</li>
	<li><strong>shrek 2</strong> - ok this already came out...so it doesn't really count...i'm not a huge shrek fan...but i hear this one is really hilarious...i'm sure i'll see it eventually...don't worry folks...</li>
	<li><strong>collateral</strong> - tom cruise as a bad guy...interesting...unfortunately they accidentally cast jamie foxx in it...oops...</li>
	<li><strong>benji returns: rags to riches</strong> - benji's back!! no way...hey i wonder if it's the same dog from the original movies...he must be getting loads of cash from all those direct-to-video releases...</li>
	<li><strong>thunderbirds</strong> - hmmm...maybe when it hits movies 4 i'll scrounge up the buck to go see it...</li>
	<li><strong>dodgeball: a true underdog story</strong> - ok, so it's got ben stiller and vince vaughn and it's about the national dodgeball championships...could be funny...but is it just me or does it seem like they're oversaturating this type of humor just a tad bit too much?</li>
	<li><strong>garfield</strong> - it does have jennifer love hewitt in it...and you gotta admit...if she showed up to your house wearing only a towel...you'd probly let her in...(sorry irresistable inside joke)</li>
</ul>
<strong>definitely not:</strong>
<ul>
	<li><strong>van helsing</strong> - more like van crapling...haha...yeah that sounded funnier in my head...</li>
	<li><strong>catwoman</strong> - do they really have to kill our hopes for the new batman movie next summer with this piece of trash? i mean c'mon...halle berry as catwoman and sharon stone as the her arch-enemy, the evil ceo of a testing-lab that uses cats in their experiments or something right? how much more contrived can movies be these days?</li>
	<li><strong>white chicks</strong> - uhoh...the wayans brothers strike again...this time as black cops that dress up as wealthy white girls...and the hilarity ensues...</li>
	<li><strong>a cinderella story</strong> - hilary duff go away...please go away...it's for your own good really...maybe then in 5 years you won't turn into a skank like every other teenage celebrity that follows the same career path as you...i'm really looking out for your best interest here...</li>
	<li><strong>yu-gi-oh!</strong> - use this only as evidence that the human race clearly is spiraling into certain destruction...</li>
	<li><strong>alien vs. predator</strong> - no...plain and simple...no...we must refuse crap when it is dealt to us and passed off as viable forms of entertainment...</li>
</ul>
ok so there you have it...everything you wanted to know about the upcoming summer movie season and more...feel free to comment with your opinions and any movies that you feel should have made the list...

...but you all know i'm right...so eat it...
