here i be...

i'm sure you've all missed me...i know i've even started missing me...who knows where i've been...but i obviously haven't been on xanga...call it a sabbatical...call it laziness and a pure lack of creative motivation...(probably more of the latter...but hey, i'm not pointing fingers)...but i've definitely missed my stream of thought postings and the quirky little comments i get from you all...so here yah go...i guess i'm back...i hope to be more consistent in the future...

so yea...i guess someone around here was dreaming of a black-out christmas...cuz that's sure what we got here in the 'crick...four whole days without power this past weekend...one of those days being the day of the year we set aside to open gifts around a fake plastic tree...not having power kind of takes the magic out of all of that...especially when said day was one of the coldest so far this year...

given all the promises of our power being restored by the power company we planned our days according to it coming back on...but by christmas eve we realized that they were simply trying to appease us...my mom and sisters stayed at my grandparents all weekend while dad and i roughed it here at the house...we had a generator going that was hooked up to our furnace and the freezer...so like the olden days when someone would have to get up to throw a log on the fire to keep the house warm...dad and i took shifts getting up during the night to fill up the generator with gas to keep it going...

so this was definitely a christmas to remember...but my memory of it won't be one of anger or frustration that we couldn't spend christmas like normal in what will be the last one here in my childhood home...no, it'll be a memory of how our family pulled together through all the setbacks and really grew closer as a result...spending the night in a hotel room all cramped together a day before christmas will do that for yah i guess...

i hope to post again soon...that all depends on your interpretation of "soon" though...

don't lose faith in me just yet xanga...
