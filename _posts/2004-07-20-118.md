ok so here's a quick lighthearted entry until i sum up all the creative writing energy within me to finish my commentary on <em>fahrenheit 451</em>...so consider this the lull before the storm...

<!-- break -->

i've been obsessed with reading lately...see that's my thing...i go on kicks...and i shall be talking about that in my next entry for sure...because i'm bothered by myself...and writing at length about it makes me feel better again...it's healing...or something...

anyways i ordered a few books from relevant and they came in last nite...i'm excited to read them and read them i shall as soon as i'm done with michael crichton's latest which has got me living from page to page...i'm over half way through it's 500 pages and i just started it fri. nite...that's good for me and my busy schedule...

tonite is six:forty...and it rocks folks...it surely does...i enjoy rockin' out every tuesday with all of you that attend...for those of you who don't attend...you must...shall you must...or must you shall...uhh...or just come sometime...if you're bored...on a tuesday...

it's a rocking. good. time.
