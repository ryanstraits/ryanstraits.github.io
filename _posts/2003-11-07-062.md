listening to: the phil hendrie show (on the net even though it's a radio show)

glorious friday...4:15 on friday to be exact...this day has flown by and so has this week...i enjoy those weeks the most...i also enjoy the fact that i have finished up just about every project i was currently working on which means less stress for me come monday...and we all know that's a good thing...

<!-- break -->

well i had quite the crazy week...last weekend, our family (sans kris) went down to easton for a lil getaway trip...we spent the nite friday and then sat. alisa and i went shopping while mom and dad went to a wedding...while we were there i just so happened to bump into the one and only chad par-due...my long lost friend who just recently moved to cincinnati...as chance would have it he was there meeting his girlfriend, sister and mom who just moved back to new phila...this was particularly weird seeing as i haven't seen the kid or barely talked to him since he moved up a month ago...how strange...however, it was great getting to hang out w/ him for the rest of the day and catching up on what all has been going on w/ him and what God has been doing in him the past few months...

speaking of cincy...i'm going down to visit all my friends that have moved down there (there are an awful lot of them) next weekend and to catch relient k when they play there next sat....it's promising to be one heck of a good time...

sunday nite my parents had their whole congregation from church out to our land for a hayride/bonfire...being a few days after halloween, a few of my friends and i decided it would be a great amount of fun to scare all the old people...and boy was it ever...my friend chris dressed up as a hatchet-wielding madman and troy was the innocent victim spattered w/ blood...eric was a wolfman and i was a ninjamaster (i know..doesn't sound that scary but think about what you would do if a crazed ninja-master ran at you while laughing a high-pitched, crazy ninja-like laugh...huh? think about that why don't yah??)...for the first batch of people, we set up an elaborate plan in a hilltop field lit only by the yellow moon...the plan included a whole scene acted out by chris/troy and then eric/me jumping at them from the back...however the driver (my dad) didn't know where we were set up at so we had to run them down and scare them...which wasn't exactly how it was supposed to play out exactly...but just keep thinking about a crazy ninja-master running at you (or jumping like a deer really) and you'll feel the fear we struck in their little hearts...for the 2nd batch of old folks we set up in the woods along "spooky hollow rd."...only this time it went exactly as planned...they didn't see it coming and we totally ambushed them...we knew we really got them by all the hay that was thrown at us...yes we got them...we got them good...

and for my week...well, it's gone on just about the same as every other week...the worship team is back to playing again and i got to test out my new bass amp and judging by the massive response i got from the audience (ok so noone really noticed except troy and josh really...), i think the new ampeg is fitting in quite nicely w/ the 6:40 sound...

so on that note i leave you sitting at your computer screen begging for me to say more...but alas i shall not...there will be more to come later...including, but not limited to, my thoughts/theories of the whole matrix trilogy...that's right, i'm going to see matrix: revolutions tonite...and ohhh how i've waited for this day to come...

friday...glorious, glorious friday...
