sunday...whilst sitting for a good three hours on our tractor mowing the great, green wonder that is our lawn...my mind (as it usually does) drifted off to a magical place full of fanciful wonder and i was (as in most cases) inspired to write a song...

so i thought i'd share this lovely little ditty with you all now...please ingest with several grains of salt and keep your tongue planted firmly in cheek throughout...

<strong><span style="color:#009999;">life lessons learned from daytime tv</span></strong>

like sands through the hourglass
so are the days of our lives
you watch as the hours pass
and wonder what living feels like

romance is only fictional
and it lives on the tv stand
and courage is optional
you've got the remote in your hand

<span style="color:#009999;">---</span>

as the world turns
you've only got one life to live
so take what you've learned
and make the most of it

cuz happiness isn't just
for the bold and the beautiful
just ask all my children down
at the general hospital

<span style="color:#009999;">---</span>

to the young and the restless
may this be your guiding light
just follow your passions
through these days of our lives
