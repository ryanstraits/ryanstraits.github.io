<em>maybe this weight was a gift...</em>

<!-- break -->

so it's november...normally a drab month for most...a little higher on my list, however...because of a certain day plum smack in the middle...that's right...it's my ol' chum <a href="http://www.xanga.com/averagejoe" target="_new">joe hartzler's</a> birthday...and it's coming fast...so make sure to get'm somethin good everyone...

it's also wednesday...and wednesday means a new lost episode...and lost means that life is beautiful once again...

<a href="http://www.xanga.com/god_save_the_fool" target="_new">skeeter</a> and i are going to save the world...and we're going to do it by taking a road trip across this great land...those of you hoping the world could be saved by christmas are indeed out of luck...unfortunately, we won't be getting around to saving it until at least the summer...we do have lives yah know...

in other news...i'm growing a beard...and i'm doing so out of indifference...

<em>like i had to see what i could lift...</em>
