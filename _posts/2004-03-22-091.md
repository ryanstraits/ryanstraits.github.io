ohio wouldn't be so bad if it didn't suck...i woke up to a thick blanket of snow and ice on the ground...glanced at the calendar...march 22nd...looked back outside...rubbed my eyes...looked again...still there...i'm slowly moving through the various stages of coping...first, denial...then, anger...and now indifference...i'm totally convinced now that ohio totally sucks and will always suck...for a while there i really believed in you oh, state that i call my own...i really thought you could pull through, be a buddy and make us all happy with some nice (dare i say) warm weather here and get our hearts beating hard for summer...but alas, you have not only let me down...but all your faithful citizens (the reason they've all remained continues to baffle me) as well...have no fear though, heart of america...there is hope for you yet...if you shape up this week and give me a sunny weekend...i won't hold it against you...go on now...give 'er the ol' college try...i know you can do it...

<!-- break -->

sorry once again for the complaining/weather-related post...i sware i'll get off it (once warmer weather finally arrives)...but lastly, i thought i'd share something that i have been thinking about alot lately...last summer i decided to sell my '96 gmc jimmy in exchange for a brand new sport-compact car...now my gmc was something that is referred to as an "suv"...something that many people believe are destroying our environment...some have proven that the excesses of toxic fumes from these vehicles are melting the ice caps and messing up our seasons...so think about this then...i sold my suv for a more "enviroment friendly" automobile...one that consumes less gasoline and emits less fumes...but in a strange twist of irony...in this car i cannot get around very well in this winter weather at all...and as the winters are supposedly getting longer and our environment more unstable...my car will have a harder time getting around...so now...tell me what kind of vehicles can get around better in snow and ice?...that's right the suv's...the very vehicles that are destroying our enviroments in the first place...while i am doing my part to help the environment...i'm now the one seemingly getting punished...what a cruel cruel world...so that is the reason i am no longer going to be doing anything to help the environment...i'll be dumping harmful chemicals down the drain...dumping my trash over the hill behind my house...hunting and gathering animals when it's not the appropriate season...among other illicit activities...

hmm...basically i'll be a redneck...maybe they are more advanced than we give them credit for...

catch ya'll 'round...
