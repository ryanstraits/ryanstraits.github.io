<span style="font-family:Verdana;">another day, another dollar and a half...but billy joe dobin liked drillin' holes...holes holes holes...that's all ol' billy joe did all day long...9 hours straight...drill drill drill...</span>

&nbsp;
then one day the plant hired a new engineer...soon after billy joe's assembly line was re-designed...the new design eliminated many steps...it was more efficient, productive and cost-effective...they now combined many of the drilling stations into one that only had to be manned by one person...someone more qualified than billy joe no doubt...ol' billy joe would now be relocated to another department or possibly even laid off...

&nbsp;
no matter what happened he knew this meant he would have to start over at the bottom and work his way up again...but billy joe liked drilling holes...he'll miss the days when that's all he did...drill drill drill...over and over again...that's all he ever really wanted to do...

&nbsp;
if wasn't for that new engineer...
