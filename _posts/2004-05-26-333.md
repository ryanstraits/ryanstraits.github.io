ok so i just realized that my posts are way too long...i even intended for my last one to be short and it ended up being long because i got this crazy idea that i'd talk about God and politics...

so maybe i should just start breaking those long posts up into a lot of shorter entries...would that work? hmmm...maybe i should just start keeping things to a minimum...well at least i'll try...i've noticed alot of people lose interest before they reach the comments link...because my comments as of late have diminished quite a bit...i think i need to have a meeting w/ my pr team to see if i've possibly oversaturated myself...

so this week i will be purchasing a new cellphone...one with a whole load of whirly-gig's and kalamazoo's...they might even throw in a few zip-zam's or jiggy-wallup's...only if i'm lucky though...i think they have a deal that if you buy now you'll receive a pack of zackerdoo's and some triple fudge go-go's...only while supplies last of course...as you can tell, i'm riddled with glee...

zip-zap'm...
