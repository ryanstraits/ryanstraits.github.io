ok so i only had time to get one post in while we were in okc...and now i'm sitting in the attic at our friend seth's place in kansas city stealing one his neighbor's internet connection...i don't know why i feel the need to always say where i'm at while i'm writing these tour journals about past shows...i just suck at intro's i guess...<br /><br />anyways...abilene is always one of our favorite places to play...the folks there are just too cool and always show us a really good time...this particular time was no different...the same dustin that set up our denton show also set up this abilene show...he's attending abilene christian university as are alot of the folks who came out to see us play this particular evening...he warned us that not that many people would show up since school is not in session but there was still a really good turnout...not as good as when we played there this past spring but still good in comparison to other places we've played thus far...<br /><br />the show was at this cool coffehouse called "monk's"...dustin is doing a really good job of booking great bands to play there...last month one of my favorite bands, "the album leaf", performed there and next month "joy electric" is playing...this month they got to see the fine musical stylings of one chris staples and discover america...and of course the winston jazz routine and a lil ol' band called state bird...we "headlined" again, i guess...i still don't think that means anything...i just think that dustin likes us alot...<br /><br />speaking of liking things alot...one thing i get to see alot of on this tour is chris staples in his underwear...yes indeedy...i'm the envy of you all i'm sure...in fact he and i are sharing this nice air conditioned attic as i speak (er, type)...which also reminds me...it's late o'clock and i'm resorting to talking about guys in their underwear...<br /><br />only two more posts and i'm all caught up...
