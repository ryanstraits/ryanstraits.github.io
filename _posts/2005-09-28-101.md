it's the weekly xanga entry and annual obligatory pre-swiss festival post all rolled into one...

and well...i don't have much to say about the festival...except that i plan on making an appearance at least one day this weekend...and though it isn't as grand as it once was...it has just enough luster to attract a sentimental junkie like me...

so everyone's talking about this new david crowder band cd...i have been greatly anticipating it's release for many, many months now...and so, being the giddy fan that i am, went to purchase said disc last evening only to realize that wal-mart didn't have it...a nationally-released album and good ol' sam walton and friends were dry as a bone...

is it really such a tall order to ask for a better place to sell music in this town than wally world? and one that could possibly sell such music for less than $20? *cough* fye *cough*....maybe i'll make a plea to ms. amy grant and her new television show to help the poor music-loving souls of t-county out when she makes an appearance here in new phila next month...

band practice tonite...first time in 3 weeks i believe...but this week the rock resumes...

and after that i think i'll get<em> lost</em>...
