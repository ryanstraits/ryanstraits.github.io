it's finally fall...we've been through winter already but at long last, fall is now here...the leaves are falling here in sugarcreek...and apparently they only fall here, because everyone and their brother from across the country comes here to watch them fall...yup, gravity works in rural america just like it does in the big city, folks...now go home and try to learn how to drive faster than 20 mph on state routes...

<!-- break -->

the new season of smallville is in full swing and i now have a reason to live...it's just about the only thing that keeps me going from week to week...i do wish that my ol' pal <a href="http://www.xanga.com/unsubscribe" target="_blank">aaron</a> was back up here obsessing over it w/ me...although, i am training a group of my friends to learn to love the show as much as i do...they can only hope to attain to the level of committment i have to such an amazing show...

tomorrow i'm goin to guitar center up in cleveland where i'm sure i'll be coaxed into buying some much needed musical gear...i haven't been there since i got my new job and actually have money...so who knows what could happen...

speaking of the new job...things are going alot better...i'm getting more and more acclimated here everyday and am getting to know people alot better...although, lately i've come to realize that i don't think i'll be content designing windows &amp; doors for the rest of my life...i think God has bigger plans for me...but for now, it's not a half-bad job...the money's good and i think it'll help me out down the line...and being in class w/ kids (and rather old people as well) down at the branch that are dreaming to have a good job somewhat related to their field, i have realized that i am extremely fortunate that God has blessed me w/ such a job and i pray that i won't ever take it for granted...

here's to tomorrow xangazonians...
