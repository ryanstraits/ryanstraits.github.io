as i sit here and watch the bucks get destroyed...i decided i needed to get my mind off football and write about several other things that are making me very happy right now...

1. mindy smith's latest album "long island shores" - i highly encourage anyone out there into country, alt-country or any variation thereof to check out one mindy smith...in a time when i was really bored with all the latest music i was hearing (except for maybe a few tracks off the shin's new recording)...ms. smith is hauntingly refreshing...well maybe i'm just praying she's still a miss and i have a shot to marry this woman...or at least her voice...or songwriting...did i mention that i really dig this album?

2. my latest recording endeavors - the holidays were good to me as far as giving me time to get my bedroom recording studio in gear (literally...hah)...and i've started working on my first lil solo debut...i know it's been several years in the making...but i've set up some realistic goals for myself and am motivated to see this one through...i hope to debut at least a few tracks here in the next month or two...i'll keep you all informed...

3. state bird's album no. 2 - the birdies are back in the studio and working furiously on the next studio album...i really like what i'm hearing so far...some really great stuff...we're going to do some touring in the spring and then in the summer so keep an eye out for that...the album should be released sometime in the summer as well...(also be watching for the winston jazz rountine's latest album coming in may...what i've heard so far is absolutely outstanding)...

4. travelling - now that school is done and over with i hope to be able to get out and around a whole lot more...we'll see what happens...but touring with the band...maybe a missions trip or camp somewhere...and a getaway with the family are are all taking top priority with me this year...

well that's all i have time for...

here's to hoping you all have something to look forward to beyond a national championship...

God bless...
