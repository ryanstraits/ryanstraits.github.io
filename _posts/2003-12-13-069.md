i am now premioso....

<!-- break -->

i don't know what that means but i coulda swore it's got something to do with being the best...which i now am...i went premium yesterday and this xanga site will never be the same...please take note of the neato banner...there shall be many more premioso things to come...

i still am not in the christmas spirit yet unfortunately...i even listened to alot of christmas cd's and songs today...tonite i believe we are going to make an attempt at christmas shopping...although for me it will most likely be a survey trip to get ideas for my eventual last-minute trip a few days before christmas...there are several things on the agenda that may have the potential to put me in a christmas-induced stupor...one being my friend <a href="http://www.xanga.com/you_neke" target="_blank">christin</a>'s annual x-mas shindig tomorrow nite...and though my work x-mas banquet was a good time this past thurs. nite, the only thing relating to work that is exciting me this holiday season besides my measly x-mas bonus and gift (a collapsable lawnchair with our logo on it!) is the fact that i may indeed be getting off a whole week inbetween christmas and new years...rejoice!

i was going to begin setting up my basement studio "the lair" today so i could do a lil recording down there now that school is out and i will hopefully be having more freetime...however, i was sidetracked by all the glitz and glory that comes along w/ xanga premium...what a shame...maybe this ain't so premioso after all...

hmmm...premioso...maybe i'm just thinking of primo...

yeah i'm that too...
