woot woot...i get to leave work at 1pm today...and that my friends, excites me...this is gonna be a good (extended) weekend...tonite i believe that troy and i--and possibly some others--are heading up to el canton to take this last chance to buy stuff for ourselves before we have to devote all our hard earned cash to all our loved ones for the holidays...should be fun...

<!-- break -->

yesterday was a good day...during the day i got the chance to talk some to a guy at work who has been going through some personal problems and i really am one of the only christians who has regular contact with him...it's crazy to me to think that i may be the only who has a chance to talk to him about it and that God could actually use me to help him...God may have put me in this situation for a time such as this...it's also neat to be putting some of the stuff i have learned in the "40 Days of Purpose" study we just finished up at church to use...if you could keep me in your prayers that would rock...i'll keep you all updated if anything else happens...

last nite i had the opportunity to get up in front of my church body and share what God has been doing in me lately mostly dealing w/ what i learned in the "40 Days of Purpose" study but alot of it God had really been teaching me all year and i really started applying what i learned during the 40 days...it was a little daunting to get up there (i'm used to bringin' the funk behind the scenes...not talking w/ all eyes on me from the pulpit...) and i wasn't quite sure why cam asked me to do it, but it was really kool for me to let everyone know that God is doing some really kool stuff in me and i'm excited about it...i hope i got across what i was feeling in my heart and that in some way i touched someone's life through it...how kool is God that he would give me that chance? stinkin' kool...stinkin' kool indeed...

well there's my quasi-serious post for the month...before i go i would like to thank all you xanger's out there for taking the time to read my site and generally be kool to me on here...you guys are the koolest...hope you all have a great thanksgiving and an enjoyable weekend off...i know i will...

1pm...yip-ta da-freakin-ee...off to lunch w/ my sis...
