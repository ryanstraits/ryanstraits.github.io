<strong>media madness</strong>

<strong>Dear Media,</strong>
For your convenience, here is a handy list of people that we, the general public, no longer have any need to hear about: Michael Jackson, Michael Moore, Linda Ronstadt, Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake, Jennifer Lopez, Courtney Love, Jessica Simpson, Paris Hilton, and Martha Stewart. Since it has escaped your attention, these people are publicity hounds, and have nothing worthwhile to contribute to the world. So please <i>shut up</i> about them and get back to reporting <i>real</i> news and events from around the world.<br>
Thank you.
