here we go...i'm gonna write something this time...i sware...

this week is off to a pretty dismal start...i'm behind on sleep and i don't think i can catch up...i'm running a race i'll never win...and sleep is very fast...the combination of school/work/etc. has begun it's slow drain on me physically and mentally...this could also be due to the fact that i purchased an xbox over the weekend and have developed a slight addiction to playing it...oh no...what have i done?...thisÂ may not have been the smartest move for me...however, i did get a pretty good deal on it off my buddy...oh well...the physical and mental repercussions are well worth the small amount of glee i receive from living my life vicariously through a digital entity...or something like that...

speaking of living vicariously through a digital entity...smallville and the oc are both all new tonite...oh what wonderful things lie in store for me...

now if i could just get through these last few minutes of work and the 1 1/2 at school i'll be just fine...

i sware i'll be just fine...i sware...
