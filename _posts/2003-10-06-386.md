<em>i guess we're just looking for someone to warm our hearts in these cold winter months...</em>

i've never considered october a winter month until this year...i enjoy the fall, the 40-60 degree weather...wearing a light jacket and watching the leaves fall...not the 30-40 degree weather we've been having lately...i don't want to get out my winter coat...in fact i refuse to wear it until at least christmas just to protest early winter weather...actually i don't even have a winter coat...that reminds me, i gotta go buy one...

i had a mildly uninteresting weekend...sat. was spent doing the same thing i do every other day for 8 hours...stare at a computer screen...i worked on an animation project for school...i was really happy that i didn't procrastinate til the day before it was due (which was sunday) to work on it...i guess i have learned something from my new job...hooray...

last nite a bunch of us went up to t-town and saw jack black's latest flick "school of rock" and it was pretty darn hilarious...you have to at least have an decent bit of knowledge of old school rock to find it as funny as my bud troy and i found it...but you may also like it if you are into movies with little kids in them...or ones w/ little kids and jack black...or movies where jack black acts crazy...or if you like movies that talk about the man....you are a robot...

thats all folks...i am tired and my day is only half over with...
