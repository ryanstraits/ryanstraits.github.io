<em>my life has become a boring pop song and everyone is singing along...</em>

ok...a quick entry before the weekend because it's sure to be a busy one...

<!-- break -->

this has been a weird week...but a good one...somehow a 10 page paper mysteriously formed in my head and flowed from my speedy fingers and turned itself in today...i have no idea how this happened...nor do i claim to understand...

but because of it's submission i now have this weekend and the entire next week free...that's right i said free...before fall semester starts...joyous rapture...i won't know what to do with myself...i'm sure most of it will be spent playing madden 2006...as most of the time i don't have now has been spent doing that anyways...

tomorrow i'm hanging with travis and then band practice...that's right...we're up to two practices a week now...that's how hardcore we are...or not...because we're not a hardcore band...actually we haven't figured out what type of band we are...but we have nearly four songs done...and that my friends...is rock 'n roll...

lastly i'll leave you with some cool things that God has kindaÂ shown me lately...i know i don't talk much about my faith on here...and i've been convicted about it recently...i don't think i take xanga that seriously most of the time...but i should every now and then...so anyways...don't expect any bible-banging...just maybe a few more thought-provoking posts from here on out...and not so many thought-imploding ones...

at any rate...here's something i wrote (while obviously in a conversation with myself) that i wanted to hold onto...so it's posted here for you all to see:

<strong>str8zstar:</strong> God can't manipulate your own free will yah know
<strong>str8zstar:</strong> he gave it to you cuz he wanted you to turn around and choose him
<strong>str8zstar:</strong> so that's why it's not instantaneous
<strong>str8zstar:</strong> because it's gotta be from us
<strong>str8zstar:</strong> it's gotta be us taking that step of faith
<strong>str8zstar:</strong> and then he'll provide the grace
<strong>str8zstar:</strong> just like baptism...that's the first step of obedience...the first step because there are so many more steps afterwards...it's us stepping and trusting him that he'll put ground under our feet...
