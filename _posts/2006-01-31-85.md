<em>you'll meet them all again on their long journey to the middle...</em>

i've tricked myself for sometime into thinking i could pull off living an exciting life while taking college classes at the same time...well this weekend i've officially dispelled that notion...i'm facing what could be my hardest semester since well...a long time...tech physics and engineering ethics just don't go along well with the rest of my life unfortunately...

so i'm going to have to put my free time on hold for roughly three months...and it pains me to do so...i don't think i've ever totally focused on school my entire college career...i've always had something worthwhile around to engage myself with to justify pushing schoolwork off to the last possible moment...there are a great many things i've been wanting to do with my spare time as many of you undoubtedly know...but responsibility is taking hold (i started on homework tonite a week before it's due, friends...i don't even know if there's a word for such anti-procrastination) and i only have a year of school left...i'm gonna finish strong, dang it...

before i came to this realization, however, i watched a few "classic" music-themed movies (almost famous and high fidelity) this weekend...and as a result have decided to take advantage of this rather dry spell of good, new music lately and revisit alot of the classic stuff i've missed out on by being born in the musically-challenged 1980's...so my second resolution from this ephiphanic weekend of mine is that i will only be listening to music pre-1980's until something else amazing comes my way...

so if anyone has any high recommendations for good music from before 1980 (sans the beatles...of course i already know they're good) for me to partake of...feel free to leave a comment and drop me a suggestion...i have a good base to start with...mostly albums i've heard about my whole life but never actually "heard"...

another busy weekend is ahead of me, unfortunately...but i have a somewhat cerebral post bouncing around in my head begging to be let out soon...so let's all pray that i am really busy this weekend so you guys won't have to deal with that, right...

until then...
