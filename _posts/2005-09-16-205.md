so you're sitting at home on a friday night...and typing to a blank white screen...when suddenly it hits you...

<!-- break -->

you have no <strong>life</strong>...

you've denied it for a while...at first you thought nothing of the <strong>shadows</strong> creeping up in the corners of your mind...but now there's <em>no</em> denying it...it's staring you <strong>dead</strong> in the face...and your thoughts can only turn now to just <em>where</em> it was that you <strong>lost</strong> your way...

maybe it was left somewhere in the fray of customary <strong>circumstances</strong>...in the fringe of <strong>common </strong>denominators...or maybe it was just simply misplaced with all the good <strong>intentions</strong> of getting it back one day...all you know is that you <em>don't</em> know...you don't know <em>where</em> you are currently or how it is that you have come to find yourself there...and you definitely don't know <em>who</em> this strange man is that faces you in the mirror nowadays...

but they can't say that you're not trying...you're endeavoring all the more to be <strong>passionate</strong>...to be <strong>spontaneous</strong>...to <strong>inspire</strong> and be inspired...to forget that which is past and press toward all that lies before...to <strong>love</strong> and be loved...to make for times that will be remembered fondly...

but you're realizing that you can't get there alone...no, but you don't <em>want</em> advice or cliched formalities...trivial statements or platitudes...you <em>want </em><strong>interaction</strong>...<em>real</em> <strong>honesty</strong>...you <em>want</em> phone calls...late night <strong>conversations</strong>...maybe you just want <strong>contact</strong><em> period</em>...

and even more than these temporal substitutes...you're realizing more and more that you absolutely <em>need</em> <strong>divine intervention</strong>...you <em>need</em> <strong>direction</strong> along this disillusioned path...you <em>need</em> <strong>grace</strong>...and a friend that sticketh closer than a brother...but what you really need...yes...what you desperately <em>need</em> is to know that you are <strong>loved</strong>...

and you're realizing that maybe you <em>always</em> have been...every broken step of the way...
