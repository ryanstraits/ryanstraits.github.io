listening to: the new amsterdams - hanging on for hope

<!-- break -->

so we actually had a glimpse of summer last nite and i enjoyed it much...i refused to drive w/ my windows up...weather like that needs to be experienced to the fullest...but in true ohio fashion...it's back to being wet and crappy outside once again...

last nite i had a wonderful time at my bud lu's house hanging out w/ alot of my friends...some i hadn't seen in a good while...some i had been waiting to see all week...it was the perfect end to a tiring week topped off w/ me being able to sleep in today...some much needed rest for the weary...

i'm so happy that more and more of my friends are getting xanga journal's now...i enjoy reading all their sites and you should learn to enjoy them too...check them out: <a href="http://www.xanga.com/hottperson" target="_blank">hottperson</a>, <a href="http://www.xanga.com/unsubscribe" target="_blank">unsubscribe</a>, <a href="http://www.xanga.com/rockinear" target="_blank">rockinear</a>and i hear <a href="http://www.xanga.com/chg" target="_blank">the chg</a> is pretty kool too...

and yes to all those who wondered...that was a country song at the bottom of my last entry...so what? country is kool now...they just changed it's name to americana in popular circles so that all the hipsters could enjoy it too...

capitol g is the hottest of them all...
