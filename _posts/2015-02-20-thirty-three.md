Or, a few notes on growing up and growing older.

### Preface


What follows is a treatise, of sorts, on my experience in growing older and the affect aging has had on several aspects of my life. It's part memoir, part advice column, part confessional. I'm certainly not claiming any expertise on the subject, just relaying my experience so far.

I've broken it down into 3 more manageable posts, and you're welcome to take any or all of them with a grain of salt. Your response will be tied to your current station in life, no doubt, and that is your prerogative. Just as those older will likely chuckle at the lessons I've learned, those younger will likely brush off my warnings, much as I did while a younger man.
 
This isn't meant to be a conversation starter, though you're welcome to weigh in. This is more an exercise in collating and fastening down thoughts that have been jangling around in my head for a few years now. It's me making sense of my journey so far and looking forward to the journey ahead.

But I also hope that you're encouraged by candor and honesty in the same way I am. I'm talking about those refreshing moments when someone speaks to a thought or an experience that you yourself have had at one point or another. To know that we're not alone in our oddities and idiosyncrasies, but that we share this sense of commonality and commiseration across the whole human race. I hope this post gives you at least one of those moments.

Because ultimately, we're all just growing old together.

### Intro: The Age Of The Lord



I turned 33 this past November. It's an age you remember your parents being but don't think you'll ever make it to yourself. It's a far-off point on the horizon. It's Marty McFly watching his dorky-dad self in the *way* distant-future of 2015. You just never think you're actually going to get there.

30 seems like it should be a more common point of reflection but for some reason, my most recent birthday seemed struck a certain significance with me. I suppose it could be because, as those of us hailing from a Judeo-Christian background will undoubtedly know, 33 is the age that Jesus completed his earthly ministry and died on the cross.

Now, it's at this point that I could probably muse on something spiritually deep like "What is the impact of my life compared with the Lord's after only 33 years?" But I'm much too practical for that line of thinking. Instead, my mind simply wonders why Jesus chose to only live 33 years before deciding that "It was finished". What was it about 33 that made him realize his work here was done?

So, I've been giving it some thought and while I'm definitely no biblical scholar, I think I may be beginning to understand His reasoning:

Basically, things just kind of start to suck around 33. 

It actually starts to suck around 30 but most of us have it in ourselves to deny it for a few years. 33 is about when the full suck really sets in. Just look at pro athletes for example, when does their game start to decline? Pretty darn close to 33. Apparently, Savior's are no different.

See, you're not quite at your mid-life crisis by 33 but you're starting to feel it slowly creep in. You feel it in your body. In your soul. You feel it in your spirit. You are getting *old*. And there is no going back.

And you gotta know that Jesus knew what he was doing: "I'll just do my thing, save the world and then get the heck outta here before I get myself a beer gut."

Take it from the Creator, it's all downhill from 33.

### Part 1: Body



Now you're always going to have those crazy outliers who will tell you, "I'm 33 and I feel great!" but remember what I said previously about denial. If you're somehow able to keep up a decent fitness regimen (see Part 2 for more on this), then you will no doubt feel pretty good until very late in life. Compared to your pre-27-year-old self however, you definitely feel like crap. You just don't know it because that's the fun thing about age: it slowly sneaks up on you. Every year you suck just a little bit more.

The truth is, that by 33, your body has already started breaking down. They say that your [age 27 year](http://io9.com/5176536/your-brain-starts-deteriorating-by-age-27-say-neuroscientists
) is [statistically](http://www.mindpowernews.com/BrainPeaks.htm) when your [mind's cognitive ability](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7945569.stm
) starts to trend downward. In turn, your body's metabolism actually starts it's long arc of decline a few years earlier, [around age 24](http://www.mensfitness.com/weight-loss/burn-fat-fast/ask-mens-fitness-what-age-does-persons-metabolism-start-significantly-slow).

"It's not fair," you think, "27 is too young to start declining." But if you would actually step back and look at the entire pantheon of human history, 27 is just a notch past our collective median age. In fact, 200 years ago the average lifespan was *barely* 40 years. In that respect, age 27 is far past mid-life and and makes quite a bit more sense as our "peak year". Our 21st century bodies just haven't caught up to our expanding life expectancies yet.

Humanity is outliving it's own body's functional lifespan.

We all know that we begin aging the moment we're born. Already my 2-year-old daughter is growing creases in her skin from playing hard and too much sun at the kiddie pool. We just don't pay attention to it until we're older. When those creases become more prominent, when the weight is a little harder to keep off and our hair starts letting go a little easier.

It's not until this point that we even think about our lives being finite. I mean, how many times do you really think about dying before you hit 30? Maybe you had a near-death or religious experience, a loss of a loved one, or a moment of clarity at your high school graduation. But on the whole, we all think we're going to live forever. Somehow we're going to rise above it if we just don't think about it.

And then your butt starts to sag a little and you snap back to reality: "Oh yea, this body is probably only going to live another 50 years." 

This sucks.

I've always been pretty keen on working out and trying to at least maintain a healthy weight. I kept up pretty well with it through my 20's. There was safety in the routine of it. I also think I inherited an irrational--though maybe healthy?--fear of getting overweight. So, my thinking was that if I could just stay a step ahead, I'd be able to head off my metabolism before it completely dropped off the cliff. This really just meant that I flailed my arms & legs on an elliptical at my parents' house roughly 3 times a week. It worked for me only because I didn't *completely* hate it.

A revelation occurred to me however, when I got into cycling in 2009. I'm not much of a runner--or an athlete, for that matter--so the simplicity of biking was something I embraced wholeheartedly. It was something I was finally good at. I bought a nice bike and while getting fit for it, the trainer commented that I had a nice pedal stroke. A nice pedal stroke! Dammit, I was *made* for this.

So I went for it full speed and racked up a lot of miles in my first few years. I took a hiatus after I moved from the expansive Ohio countryside to Kansas City and it's congested suburban streets. Then in 2011, I worked up the nerve and started wading through traffic and working my way back in to it. It was true love. I passed 2,000 miles on my bike in 2012 after nearly 3 seasons of riding.

And then my daughter was born.

As a young man, I used to subtly scoff at folks who let their bodies go after they had kids. I would think they used their kids as an excuse to overeat and not take care of themselves. "What a sorry lot," my silly, young brain would think.

These days, I tend to glance sideways at those middle-aged parents who are in better shape now than they were in their 20's. I mean, overcompensate much? Amirite?

# Part 2: Soul


I'm a self-styled old soul, so you'd think getting older would suit me just right. 

Being a self-styled old soul, you'd think I'd be taking getting older quite well.

# Part 3: Spirit
