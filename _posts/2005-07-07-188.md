away with the face/off picture...i think the point has been made...my appearance has drastically changed...but now it's even freaking <em>me</em> out...yipes...

<!-- break -->

so on to another scary picture...all i can think of when i see this picture is "gnarly"...most likely because i'm snarling...and that quasi-rhymes with gnarly...

i don't know what's up w/ all the mean-looking pictures lately to those who have been appalled at my supposed nastiness...i think it's the fact that it's me taking those pictures of myself that gets me all ticked off...who really likes to do that?...so if you'd like to come give me a hip xanga photo shoot...i'm sure that'd be cause enough to make me smile...

well tonite is consisting of what my life has mostly consisted of for the past three weeks...homework...and not just regular homework...online condensed summer class homework...and lots of it...this week is the midterm...so of course the instructor feels morally obligated (for some reason) to inundate us with a huge assignment that is worth the better part of our grade...

well...this should be a lovely weekend...flatter me, digital friends...and leave me lots of fun and interesting comments to read...as i shall be no doubt switching back and forth between classwork and my xanga to make sure that i still am indeed measuring some form of higher brain function...
