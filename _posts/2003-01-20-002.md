nothing new since the last time i wrote....nothing new at all...

<!-- break -->

&nbsp;

<em>get the light on your way out</em>

<em>*snap*snap*snap*snap*</em>

<em>*snap*snap*snap*snap*</em>

<em>don't be there when it falls</em>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<em>never let the dawn appear again</em>

<em>*snap*snap*snap*</em>

<em>go and find a way around it</em>

<em>hurry up and get your gun</em>

<em>tell the world it's over</em>
