wow...how about those americans last night...kickin' butt and takin' names at the olympics...i tell yah what...if gymnastics wasn't like the craziest thing a human's ever done with their body i would have swore paul hamm's fairytale comeback victory over those koreans was fixed...but how the heck could you ever stage a bunch of short dudes flying around on high bars, pommel horses and such...i practically wetted myself with excitement after ol' hottie hamm eked out that gold over nearly impossible odds...i do have to say that was one of the most incredible olympic moments i've ever seen...and now i have all kinds of national pride and hope in the human spirit and all that emotional malarkey that comes along with the olympics...isn't it great...

<!-- break -->

you better believe i'll be engrossed in the games once again tonight...let's go phelpsie...i'm addicted to this feely-good nonsense now...make me proud to be an american again, dang it...

work has been even more insane than the men's gymnastics all-around lately...if you can imagine that...we're somewhat shorthanded this week so besides feeling like i'm being pulled in every direction i've had like 10 people that have been calling me and saying they have things that require my utmost attention...i'm really drawing on all the strength i've gained from watching the olympics to pull through...help me now hammy...i need you know more than ever...

ok enough about the twenty-eighth olympiad...proceed to the following portions for a more enjoyable xanga experience...

<strong>thoughts of a passerby</strong>

"hey look at that guy singing in his car...i don't think i've ever seen anyone sing before..."

"that kid just passed me! i was only going 5 mph below the speed limit!! i think an appropriate response to this would be to match his speed and turn my brights on..."
