<em>your gravity pulls you so far away...thinking, how long will this last?...</em>

<!-- break -->

ol' man winter is knocking on the door...and i am desperately not wanting to let him in...every winter i complain and complain more and more...so i'm vowing this winter to not get all disgruntled at the inevitable salt, slush and dastardly frigidness...i'm pretty convinced that that just makes it worse...but i'm also becoming more and more convinced that if God intended me to live in a winter wonderland my entire life he probably should have instilled more of a love for the bleak near-arctic temperatures that consume just about three-quarters of the year here...or at least that's how my mind works anyways...

<em>***end complaining***</em>

well it's been a busy last few weeks...sorry my posts have been few and far between...i hope to up my consistency on here for the future...and i've got charts and graphs to prove it...my efficiency will increase...i promise you...but anyways, nearly every weekend for the past 4-5 weeks i've been busy doing something or the other...i've barely touched my computer at home...so thus...the lack of xanga attention...most of my time has been spent revolved around weddings...in fact, i can't seem to go a day without hearing something about a wedding or an engagement or some form of matrimonial blissfulness...sick (that's for you lain)...

let's see if i can recount it all for you...five weeks ago...jt and laura got married...the following weekend was something...but i can't remember what...the weekend after that was the swiss festival and the six:forty worship band led worship in big church...so most of sat. that week was spent setting up and getting ready for that...then the week after that andy (six:forty drummer) got married...somewhere in there my good friend chad called me to ask me to be a groomsmen in his wedding (it's next april in florida...score!)...this past weekend the six:forty worship band played "the music portion" of sarah and scott's wedding...it was fun and aaron and i got to sing "getting into you" and that was a great deal of fun...but all this planning, preparing and setting up is really starting to wear me out...then today i get the news that my bud flin just got engaged over the weekend...we're losing another one...but those of you who know flin...know he's way past due...so needless to say...i (along with the rest of six:forty) am overly happy for the guy...

now on top of all this coldness...i've contracted some strange variant of a cold...i first came down with a sore throat on thursday through friday...saturday i had body aches...and then sunday the brunt of the sickness hit me good and hard...congestion and sinus pressure...and as cold's go...they last just past the point of annoyingness and add absolute frustration to an already hectic life...isn't it wonderful...oh oops...i forgot that i'm done complaining for this post...

so i guess that means i can't complain to you that i have to weather the wet and cold to trek to my oh-so-fascinating statics class tonite...yea i guess that's complaining too...and the fact we're having an exam would add even more to the whining wouldn't it? yea it sure would...

<em>***re-end complaining***</em>

on second thought...this whole post has been one big complaint...so feel free to disregard it entirely...i hope to post again with potentially deeper subjects to be written about...i leave you now with an edgy version of notable quotes...if you get easily offended you might not want to read these...but i found them both highly comical...

<strong>notable quotes</strong>

"asexuality: it's not just for amoebas anymore" -<em> t-shirt slogan promoting awareness and acceptance on asexuality from the asexual visibility and education network...apparently people have a problem with that...</em>
