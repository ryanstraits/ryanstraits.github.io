i want to apologize for the lack of updates...i guarantee you life didn't end for us after we got robbed but according to this tour blog, it has...<br /><br />a combination of alot of travelling, no internet and spending a few days at cornerstone made it nearly impossible to dedicate time to writing on here...we're in harrisonburg, virginia right now and we're heading to virginia beach tonight so hopefully i'll have time to write there...<br /><br />hope you all are doing well...thanks for your patience and for taking time to read about our silly adventures on the road...<br /><br />take care...
