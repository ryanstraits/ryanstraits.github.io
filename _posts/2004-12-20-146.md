<em>...i don't know what i'm doing in this city...</em>

<!-- break -->

you know how certain albums or songs can define particular moments or events we've experienced in life? is anyone else like that or is it just me?...there are just those songs or albums that i can't listen to unless i want to go back to the time in my life that it's associated with...

take for example "our lady peace - spiritual machines"...when i hear that album i automatically go back to the various roadtrips that joe, dave and i took to pittsburgh to see the juliana theory live...especially the night dave got his car towed during the concert...we had to go buy it back from those slumlords and they cornered us in their office and made us all fear for our lives and the lives of our unborn children...then we got lost on the way home...and the big green monkey almost got us...when i hear that album...i'm instantly back there...in dave's car...on the way to or from pittsburgh...the same thing happens when i listen to "ben folds - rockin' the suburbs"...i think it was the winter of '02/'03...that's where that album takes me back too...it's like they're some form of sonic-nostalgic time device...i can't listen to them without being transported back to the first time they entered my ears...

isn't it crazy how we associate sounds, smells, and even sights to various events from days gone by?...whether good, bad or meaningless...sometimes i wonder if deja-vu is this same association occurring but we don't remember the event it's related too...

<em>i've never been so alone...and i've never been so alive...</em>
