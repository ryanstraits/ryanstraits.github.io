and he rested on the 7th day...

<!-- break -->

just had to add that in given that i recently posted the 7th and final of my albania entries which chronicled our 6th day there...so i rested on the 7th day when we got home...haha...yah ok whatever...

so i'm sure you all are sick of my entries detailing the trip to albania so i'll fill you guys in on what's goin on in my life lately...since i know that's so much more exciting...

finished up my semester at school on wed...i actually shouldn't be done til next wed. when my class takes their final...but because i've aced the three previous exams i won't be needing to because our prof drops the lowest grade...how kool...this taking only one class a semester business is really paying off...i'm glad that i decided to go ahead and go to school this sem...the class was easy and gave me some knowledge i'll use in my job...and i never really got overly stressed about schoolwork or what have you...it ended up being a positive experience...and i got to hang out in the class with some of my good bud's from down there at the branch...good deal...so thanks to everyone who convinced me to go back this sem...i think i'll be taking another class next semester if i stick around t-county...so at this rate i'll graduate w/ my bachelors in 2024...saaweeet...

work for the most part has been going well...today it's a ghost town around the office...they still haven't hired a replacement for the other engineer who resigned....dick is off with the bigwig's at our "platinum club" getaway...and all of production left at 10am...so it's just me...and this computer...sharing a drink called loneliness...oh wait...that's a song...oh well...it's better than drinking alone i guess...

so this weekend a whole load of us singles from six:forty are heading down to salt fork in cambridge for our annual spring retreat...jeff cox is coming to speak once again...should make for some good times...and i think God is gonna do some kool things...

well...summer has finally heard my pleas of agony and is well on it's way...and now that school's done i can actually start enjoying it...but of course i'm cramped up in this daggone office all day long...hmmm...tastes like a cruel tinge of irony has been added to my loneliness juice...if it wasn't for that it'd be quite a tasty beverage...
