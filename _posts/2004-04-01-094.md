well...one of two things has happened...either i'm writing to you from a war-torn, third-world, technologically backwards country...or...our flight was cancelled due to extremely foggy conditions at cleveland airport yesterday...so while "april fools" may be seem like a very appropriate tag-on after that last statement...it is in fact the truth...i'm still in ohio...and i still hate it here...what a disgusting april fools joke on me...and then today it snows...snow in april...how much worse can it get...

<!-- break -->

so yeah...we're all a little bummed cuz we should be in albania on a missions trip right now...but the shekinah glory of God (i.e. the fog) descended upon cleveland and wouldn't let us leave...so at least now we know that we're working on his timetable and not our own...we got our flights rescheduled for tomorrow (fri.) and will have to do with just a 7 day trip...which doesn't seem quite worth it...but we're still believing God is gonna do some incredible stuff in and through us over there...we're being redirected through toronto and will have a 9 hour layover there and then an 11 hour layover in vienna, austria...so we're probly gonna go out and peruse around those cities some...i've heard vienna's amazing so i can't wait...

so one high point to the day yesterday besides laying around in cleveland airport waiting for all our connecting flights to eventually get cancelled was that i bumped into my bud matt thiessen...he was just getting back from baltimore where he did some guest vocal work on don't look down's latest cd...i haven't chatted with him in a while so it was kool to catch up...i also heavily reprimanded him for standing us up in cincy by forgetting to put our names on the guestlist...however, he claims it was one of the worst days of his life...so i kinda had to forgive him for it...i told him he could make it up to me by coming down and helping me lead worship at six:forty sometime in the future...but i'm not holding my breath...

over and out (of america)...

hopefully...
