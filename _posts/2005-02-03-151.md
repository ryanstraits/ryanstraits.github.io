ok so before i post my mammoth "best albums of 2004" entry (which i've already started compiling...and boy is it a doozy)...i thought i'd just update everyone on what's currently going on in my life seeing as alot of you have asked about it 'n so on...i thought that my last entry should have been sufficient enough for you...understanding that i'm in deep cover and whatnot...but apparently that's not good enough...so anyways...here's what's been goin' down in my world lately:

<!-- break -->

unfortunately, school is back underway...but this semester shouldn't be too bad...i just have one class once again (and at this rate i'll get my bachelor's in like three freegin' years)...but it's one of the most boring classes i've taken there so far...fluid power...yea it's hydraulics...blaaaahh...i mean what a waste of time and brainpower...sometimes i really wonder what the heck i'm doing in engineering...i mean it's a feasible decision for a career...the pay is good (especially after i get that danged bachelor's)...but i definitely stick out like a sore thumb in that program that's for sure...and how many engineers do you know that moonlight as worship leaders, musicians, movie critics and aspiring filmmakers? yeah not many...and if you do a few i can bet you they're not happy with their jobs...i've really been seeking God's guidance in this area to the max lately...there's been no break in the clouds just yet...but i'll keep you all posted...

after work and school my life there is a flurry of activity...i'm still leading worship tues. nights at six:forty...now that's going very well...we've been doing alot of killer new tunes lately and hope to debut quite a few more in the coming months...i'm darn excited...plus my longtime friend and former bandmate josh garrett has joined up with us to play drums...his girlfriend kendra has also come on to play some keyboards for us...it's been working out very well and i'm really happy to have them both in the band...six:forty as a whole has been pretty rad...i'd say we're on the upswing from kind of a low point over the past few months...we're going to be focusing in several different areas of ministry in various teams...of course i'm attached to the worship band...but i've also got stakes in the website development team and an exciting new filmmaking venture which i can't wait to get underway...obviously my time is pretty stretched as it is...but if the film team (which i've affectionately dubbed "faux reel") pans out it's something i'm really wanting to dedicate heart and soul to because it's really become one of my passions over the past few years...

which brings me to the next area of my extra-curricular activities...movie reviews...another thing that i've enjoyed doing but have had some problems fitting into my schedule...but it's been working out decently enough so far...i've met most of my deadlines...key word: <em>most</em>...and have submitted roughly eight reviews so far and hope to do many more for the future...by the way...you can read my latest review of the thriller "hide and seek" <a href="http://www.the-review.com/archive/02032005/PDF/C03.pdf" target="_new">here</a> if you'd like...

and then finally...with the measly, remaining scraps of time left behind by the gluttonous ogres that are work and school i have been attempting to get back into recording once again...so far it's been going very well...it's hard to stay dedicated...especially with madden football calling my name from that diabolic wonder known to most as the xbox (which i've won three super bowls straight on by the way *ahem* thank you very much)...but i've been tearing myself away in the past week or so and the results have been very fulfilling...i've gotten all the guitars, bass and drum tracks just about done on my first song...i hope to do strings/keys sometime this weekend and then move on to vocals in the near future...they will undoubtedly take the most time of all as i'm never satisfied with how my voice sounds on tape...so we'll see what happens...i'm hoping to have it done in a month's time...so if purevolume cooperates i hope to have my first foray into "solo-musician-dom" up there for you all to listen to and subsequently scream as your ears will most likely be removed from your head...either from pure elation or extreme terror...i haven't decided yet...

ok so this entry's been alot about what i've been <em>do</em>ing recently...i might be able to find it in me to post one of those all-important <em>be</em> entries coming up soon...that is...after the infamous and undeniably collossal "best albums of 2004" post which i should have up by the week's end...stay tuned...

oh...do make sure to hop over to <a href="http://www.xanga.com/kaitrich" target="_new">kate's</a> site where she's posted the article she wrote about six:forty...i'm heavily featured throughout if that's any motivation for you to read it...tehehe...

have a good one all...thanks for taking remote interest in the life and times of lil ol' me...
