a moving picture that actually moved...

<!-- break -->

i think that's a rarity in this day and age...a movie that actually inspires a change? many movies these days can arrest our attention, drum up emotion, or strike a chord in our being somehow...but how many of those feelings ever last outside the theater and change the way we actually live our lives? i've encountered several movies over the course of the past few years (many of which i would name as my favorites) that have changed the way i view movies or have changed the type of movies i most enjoy...but none have conjured up any questions in the core of my being...none as powerful as the movie i watched last thurs. nite...i don't even think i need to mention the title because most of you will already know what movie i'm talking about...

eurotrip...

...obviously i'm just kidding and have blown any chances of making this a serious post but i just wanted to see if you're paying attention...anyways, i'm really talking about the much-hyped, uber-controversial "the passion of the christ" flick...many of you have probably seen it and those of you who believe what i believe were no doubt very shaken by the events in the film as i was...sometimes we need a wake-up call like the one given in the movie...we are truly a visual nation...and need stuff like that sometimes to remind us of the great cost at which we have our salvation...

now for those of you who are turned off by the fact it's a religous-oriented film, that mel gibson helmed the movie, all the controversy, or that most of christianity as we know it has latched on to it and nearly claimed it as their own...whatever your objection is i would challenge you to try to forget it...forget all the people tied to it...forget the fact that it's about one of the most widely-known humans ever to grace this earth...forget your religious affiliation...forget everything you've heard about it...just go into the theater and watch it for what it is...a movie...only then will you be able to catch the heart behind the story...

or you could go watch eurotrip...i'm sure it's very uhhh...moving...
