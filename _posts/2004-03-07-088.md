<em>this is me at my truest...</em>

<!-- break -->

this is me without any witty lines or clever phrases to inhibit my true feelings...and so i am compelled to write...i've been working on this lab report for class for way too long now...i've missed a chance to further my social skills, crack jokes with friends and pass the time with people who all wish they were paired off...but alas, i cannot attend...i am dedicated...i may be a procrastinator...but i am a dedicated one...but now it seems the caffiene fizz and carbonated bubbles from my diet beverage are beginning to wear off and i'm losing focus...my mind is gone...but my heart has been thinking all nite...

so now the moment of truth...should i tell you how i really feel? you've made it past all my checks...all my standards...you're one of a rare few...congratulations...job well done...i've been thinking about you more lately...and at first i just couldn't decide where to place you...but now that i've finally figured it out...i come to find i'm too late...it's my fault and i'm sorry...you deserve better anyways...congratulations...

<em>this is me at my bluest...</em>
