so yes i decided to ditch a few extra pounds before i left for cali...aka i cut all my hairs off...as you can see in the before/after picture to the left...freaky huh...but believe me it was mucho nice to not have to deal with the mop while we were camping in mexico...

speaking of the trip...later tonite or tomorrow i hope to post a few pics and a maybe share a few harrowing tales including how we got stuck at the mexican border, how to deal with crazy expatriates, and how i wound up on a tlc show...i can tell that you're all so very keenly interested now aren't you...

tune in for more tomorrow...same boring time...same boring channel...
