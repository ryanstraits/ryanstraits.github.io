so this could be a first...over the next two weeks the entire straits family will be completely spread out across this little rock we like to call earth...

<!-- break -->

tomorrow my mom and both sisters are embarking on a two week cruise around the greek isles with members of the maternal side of the family (my grandpa and his sisters are 100% greek)...and yes i did have a chance to go on this same cruise...but i opted out in favor of a trip of my own...oh wretched fool that i am...

this coming tuesday my dad will be leaving for a missions trip to the phillipines...he'll be gone for a week...and then next saturday i'll be flying out to californ-i-a for a week...yes this is the trip i cancelled goin to greece for...yea i know it's cali...but geez...a cruise around the greek isles...eeek...and they sail out of venice, italy...*tear*...what was i thinkin?...

man, but i know cali is gonna be cool...don't really know a whole lot of the folks i'm goin' with...but i'm thinkin' God set it up that way for a reason...i know a good bit of the people out there from when i went last year...so i'm excited to just get to chill with them for a week and then hit up LA again for a day or so...that and just being in california will be worth it for me...there's always more chances to go to greece...i think...i hope...i wonder...

ahh what adventures wait for me tomorrow...i'll be springing right up outta bed at 4:30am like the spry morning guy that i am...and driving w/ two coworkers of mine to cleveland for a conference...leaving up there around noon or so...coming home and then traversing <em>back </em>to ikea in pittsburgh to exchange a vital part of my entertainment center that was damaged upon arrival...it's gonna be a long day folks...one in which i'll be travelling hundreds of miles on very little sleep...

i can hardly wait...to go to bed...like right now...
