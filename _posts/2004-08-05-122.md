for those of you who even remotely care...here are a few interesting tidbits i found while wandering around the net today...

<!-- break -->

always remember <a href="http://www.pfm.org/BPtemplate.cfm?Section=BreakPoint_Home&amp;Template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=13245" target="_blank">"art cannot be higher than morality"</a> ...and check out what the folks at the <em>independence institute</em> have recently come up with...they've found <a href="http://www.davekopel.org/Terror/Fiftysix-Deceits-in-Fahrenheit-911.htm" target="_blank">59 deceits in <em>fahrenheit 9/11</em></a>...and it was compiled by a democrat who voted for nader in 2000, amazingly enough...(sources: <a href="http://www.fusemagazine.net/" target="_blank">fuse magazine</a> and <a href="http://www.relevantmagazine.com/" target="_blank">relevant magazine</a>)

for those who choose not to care about all that politics-tinged mumbo jumbo...please forget you even came across this little prelude and proceed to the "real" entry below...

ok so i admit it...i'm addicted to watching that new amish reality show...i know i'll be shunned by our conservative community for doing so (pun intended)...but i've come to enjoy it for some reason...for those of you who don't know...i live in the thick of the amish community...i've come to know many of them...and don't marvel at their existence like the rest of the world...they're just people...yeah they ride in buggies and are quite annoying if you get behind one when you're in a rush...or if you are constantly having to dodge the nice, big messes their horses leave behind right in the middle of the road with your pimpin' sweet ride...but they aren't all that different for all the attention they seem to receive...oh, and they receive it alright...this whole area is built on tourism...it's like a symbiosis of sorts...

but living in coexistence with the amish has become a way of life for many of the people around here...my dad works with them all the time...in fact he's even picked up their language...we've been close with one particular amish lady for the past 16 or so years...she was our babsitter when my sisters and i were younger and now helps my mom clean our house...today we just celebrated her 60th birthday...i went home from work on my lunch hour and my mom, my sisters and i threw a little party for her...we got her a cake and a present and everything...she's like one of the family...it was great...and it was no big deal to us...

well everyone around here was all up in a fuss because of this show...and how it's going to exploit amish kids and shame the amish community...one of the girls on the show is from just up the road in holmes county...now i've been watching this for the past two weeks now...and what they're doing is putting five amish kids in a house with six normal kids in los angeles during a period of an amish person's life when they're allowed to experience the ways of the world to decide if the amish life is for them...

everything that ensues is pretty much textbook reality show fluff...the amish have never seen anything modern before...the modern kids haven't seen amish before...and you can pretty much predict the rest from there...see but the thing is...instead of exploiting the amish...i think the show is really making the city kids look more stupid...if nothing else they're painting the amish to look like more genuine people and the city kids into spoiled brats...but i know editing plays into all this...and for goodness sakes it's a gersh dern reality show...and da devil's in dat der television anyways...i think i'm chust gonna throw away dis devil's box...and chust gonna stop talkin' bout it...how's dat...

ok so i'm itching to do some recording again here soon...as alot of you know...i made it my goal for the summer to record a 4 song demo by the time school starts...well school is nigh upon me and i barely have one song down...it's a pitiful thing i know...and the bad thing is i have no excuse...

i have been doing better at writing though...i wrote a worship song and debuted it tuesday at six:forty...it's called "the only one"...and i enjoy it greatly...i thank all the guys on the team for bearing with me in trying to convey my ideas for the song to them...they did a marvellous job of pulling it off on very little practice and for it just gracing their ears sunday afternoon...

i'm in the midst of writing another worship tune...not sure if it's right for corporate worship...but we shall see...i have a few ideas for some others...including adapting various psalms into modern phrasing n such...God's word will never be out of date and never seems to fail in making great worship tunes...we'll see what comes of it...
