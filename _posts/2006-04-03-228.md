i'd say that i'll be updating you all on life soon...but you all knowÂ i'd just be lying...so here's a quick rundown:

i'm flying to atlanta this weekend for an ol' friend's wedding...and then participating in a wedding for one of my bestest buddies the following week...school and work are both equally heating up with summer just on the horizon...i'm planning out what classes i'll be taking this fall (my final classes ever...mind you)...and that's a good thought to have in my head...and i think that's just about it...

almost...
