well...i'm all out of things to say...i think i exhausted my sentiments for really the entire summer with that last post...thanks to those of you who thought it kind to leave a few encouraging words with me...it's nice to know i have digital friends in low places...but the summer is over now...and that chapter is closed...

bring on the fall...

<!-- break -->

but not literally of course...i too much enjoy walking upright...speaking of walking around and doing it aimlessly...i'm really looking forward to hittin' up the fair at some point this weekend...and then of course the swiss festival next weekend...i don't think i've missed it once since birth...there's just something about it...the nostalgia i guess...it's the official start of autumn...

on that note...

<strong><span style="color:#afbfcf;">six randumb things</span></strong>
<ul>
	<li>so that tlc show i was on while in los angheles should be airing any day now...keep your eyes glued to your television sets for when it may appear...and then be sure to let me know...you think i'm actually gonna watch tlc just to see my kisser on tv? yea...fat chance...</li>
	<li>i can't freegin' wait for the 2nd season premiere of "lost" tonite...but if you know me well at all...well then, you already knew that...</li>
	<li>i'm on my third cellular device in roughly a month's time...the first one lasted for about a year and several hundred faceplate-plants into the pavement before it conked out...it was a fighter that's for sure...the 2nd one lasted not even a month before it's screen decided to go blank (after only one big drop...wimp)...let's see if i can shatter even more records (and several shiny plastic parts as well) with this new one...</li>
	<li>so for those of you keeping score...that brings my total number of cell phones over the years up to seven...ring ring ring...cellular modular interactive-odular...</li>
	<li>"hi...i'm from corporate...may i have your trash?"...</li>
	<li>introducing the masculine form of <a href="http://www.xango.net" target="_new">xanga</a>...kick? looks like he needs a swift one...</li>
	<li>i said there would be six random things above...but actually there are seven...this one doesn't technically count though...but isn't that just so darn random of me?</li>
</ul>
<em>you can breathe now...but the air is running out...</em>
