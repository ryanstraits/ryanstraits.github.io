net at work is down...possibly for good...

i lost my cell phone last weekend...yes my new one...don't ask...

i feel like i've lost all connections with the outside world...but strangely enough...i kind of enjoy the dissociation...

or maybe i just enjoy the ignorance that i'm afforded now...

watch the weekends for new postings...
