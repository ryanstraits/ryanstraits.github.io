<em>(note: this entry was started thurs. afternoon and finished fri. nite...i.e. i got busy at work and didn't have time to finish it...i.e. i am a very important person...i.e. i don't know what "i.e." actually means...)</em>

<!-- break -->

for the 2nd time in that past month we've had sales meetings here at work...all those darn salesmen from all over the states have gathered once again in a room on the other side of my office wall...i, however, remembering how horrible my experience was the last time they were here have come prepared for this day...i wore a sweater...ha! take that you pesky, overly-jubilant, uppity-up salesmen! i am ready for you and the freezing cold temperatures you bring to my office...(note to self: when the next sales meeting is looming, remember to bring some form of odor-destroying device to block the horrible smells eminating from their always huge, odious lunchtime buffet...)

for x-mas this year my parents surprised our family w/ a tivo...now for those of you who have no idea what in the fondrook that is...it's this new-fangled tv recording gadget that records shows n whatnot off your tv without using those ancient recording devices called videotapes...this is a very good thing for me because as most of you probly know, i don't just watch my favorite tv shows (i only have 2 of them right now)...i tape them because i usually don't have a chance to watch them when they're on tv live...with tivo i just punch in what show i want and it will record the whole entire season for me...it also learns what shows you like and will just tape shows of that sort for you...i looked tonite and found out it had taped macgyver for me...now i don't know how tivo knew it...and i'm actually quite scared to find out...but macgyver is one of my favorite shows of all time...maybe tivo is not only a tv recording device but also a freakishly intuitive psychic on the side...hmm...oh well...all i know is it tapes my favorite shows for me...this now gives me the chance now to use the word "tivo" alot in sentences...which is always something i've deeply longed for...i'll say such things as: "hey don't worry about taping that show, i <em>tivo'd </em>it for yah", "you can just come over to my house and watch some <em>tivo</em>", "mom do we have any left over scraps? <em>tivo </em>looks pretty hungry", "i only do as <em>tivo</em> says, he is my all-sufficient, all-knowing leader", and "when i was young i was televisually abused by <em>tivo</em>"...you know stuff like that...i feel that i'm pretty hip now...so don't you forget it...

<strong>today's lesson on becoming a responsible adult:</strong> tonite i realized the importance of making decisions based on whether they are good/better/best for me...too often i do things because they'll be fun or because i feel as if i'll really miss out if i don't...i  believe that there isn't always one right answer to every situation...sometimes God allows for several right answers with some being more profitable than others...tonite i opted out of going bowling w/ some guys at 11pm so that i could get to bed at a decent time because i am hanging out w/ cam and some guys early tomorrow...for me the best thing is not being tired...of which i have been way too much lately...

man, this growing up crap is really killing my social life...
