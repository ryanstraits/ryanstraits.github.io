probably one of the most hauntingly beautiful songs that has ever entranced these ears of mine right here...i think that even without the trippy vocoder effects i would still make out with her voice any ol' day of the week...

<!-- break -->

i don't comment much on songs but well...there i did...i'm trying to talk more of things outside of my own self...cuz besides realizing that i have this knack for never finishing anything i start...i'm also coming to find that i'm increasingly selfish...and yet i don't realize it til now...after the fact...i guess it's probably stemmed from my recent social hibernation of the past few years...which originated with the fact that i really had no friends to be social with for a good while there...and so the process continues to repeat itself...i'll break out of my funk one of these days...or i'll just break out the funk...

i've been reading <em>blue like jazz</em> and i would probly add it to my "currently reading" box sometime if it weren't for the fact that it's not nearly as trendy as putting music there instead...because even though you're not listening to the album that you say you are "currently listening to"...you still want to look hip by putting it in there...but of course i've never done that before (and i really should have put all that in parentheses)...moving along...<em>blue like jazz</em>...ah yes...so i've been finding it very applicable to where i find myself at in life and this recent anti-social crisis as of late...it's fit in well right after <em>mere christianity</em> in some strange way...maybe i'll save thoughts on that for another day...and rhyme some more but that's pretty gay...

it's extraordinarily late...and i've really said nothing this entire entry...so there, xanga...that's what you get when i'm forced to post an entry out of due diligence...you get mind-dulling fluff...take it or leave it...

"you...are...awesome...you have arrived in life...and you're driving a checkered dodge neon..."
