<em>the heartbreaking makes a sound i never knew could be...so beautiful and loud...</em>

<!-- break -->

it's time to get this weekend under way...now if only the clock would oblige...it's been a hectic week...but fortunately the frenzied pace at which it progressed was directly proportional to it's inherent madness...and ultimately i'm unanimously in favor of it being over...

i love how i always end up devising detailed outlines for how the upcoming weekend will be a successful one on these slow, sleepy friday afternoons...and then i get myself all riddled with glee for how absolutely amazing it's going to be...and then of course...i end up just sitting around...becoming spectacularly lazy and getting nothing constructive done whatsoever...

but no more shall this be the case, friends...for one, i decided that john madden will no longer have the rule over my spare time...i began to think about what nuggets of value i get out of that black rectangular box...and what i came up with was just a wee bit shy of nothing...i mean besides all the invaluable info i've gained on how to build a winning nfl team and successfully keep said team under the salary cap of course...

and now with the likely implosion of the band i've been touting as my latest musical venture creeping on the horizon...i decided to resurrect my solo recording project...most of my gear found it's way into a darkened corner of our basement after we moved this summer...so i finally started getting things back in order this week...and even started dusting off my collective creative energy as well...i have found that some time away can really help to get a clear perspective on such trend-inspired things as music...especially when it comes to that funny little thing called originality...

so out of the ashes...another rises...i believe that's what they say...but i've got no time for such drivel...it's the weekend...and i've got glorious things to accomplish...

<em>here it comes...a beautiful collision...</em>
