ok...so the uber-entry was near completion...when of course things had to go horribly awry...

<em>i deleted half of it...</em>

i was gonna try to be clever and cut it in half...i cut the top half...submitted the bottom half...and re-pasted my cut half into a new entry...when to my horror it was the bottom half...i've been thinking over this turn of events for the past half-hour and i'm pretty sure i'll carry the mystery of how this misstep occurred with me for the rest of my life...

it's a sad, sad day here in xanga-ville...

lament with me as i go take a shower and attempt to rid myself of all this shame and self-digust...

who knows what will become of the much-hyped uber-entry now...it lays in ruin...hopefully one day i will be able to pick up it's pieces and bring it back to life once again...

one day...
