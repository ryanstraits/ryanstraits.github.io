listenin' to: <em>dashboard confessional - several ways to die trying</em>

dashboard w/ electric guitars...it's kind of an oxymoron...but sure enough there they are...chris screaming in front of wailing electrics...reminds me of another band...oh yeah further seems forever...kind of have the same thing going on...oh wait they're pretty much the same band now...well, i guess the new cd isn't that bad if you can get past the electrics...i'm sure that will be a big hang-up for alot of people...oh well...who cares anyways...

so i'm home alone on a wednesday night...and i don't have much to say...i guess i have one interesting tidbit for you all: the power team is out in holmes county tonite...yes, THE power team...the group of crazy christians who break things for jesus...now if that's your cup of tea then that's kool...but beware as they may take your tea and throw it in your face right after they smash the table your sitting at...don't say i didn't warn you...

so friday night i'm hanging out w/ an old friend that i really have seen in like 2 years...it's pretty neat how God can take someone you thought you may never see again and cross their paths w/ yours once again...

thanks to all you kansas city kids who left me comments...you guys are the koolest...let's make sure to keep in touch...

my pillow beckons...
