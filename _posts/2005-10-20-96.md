<strong><span style="color:#afbfcf;">str8zstar:</span></strong> i just emailed this stupid vendor of ours on a print change we're making and i just know he's gonna call me about it and ask what it's for and all these dumb questions...i can't wait
<strong>c44bad22:</strong> just punch him
<strong><span style="color:#afbfcf;">str8zstar:</span></strong> i wish i could send a digital punch
<strong>c44bad22:</strong> just flood him with emails
<strong>c44bad22:</strong> email bomb him
<strong><span style="color:#afbfcf;">str8zstar:</span></strong> i like the way you think
<strong><span style="color:#afbfcf;">str8zstar:</span></strong> i wonder if that's professional or not
<strong>c44bad22:</strong> sure if you do it right

i think theÂ "co" in coworker is short for comiserate...
