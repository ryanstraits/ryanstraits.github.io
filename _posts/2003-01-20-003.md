martin luther king jr. day...rejoice! i plan on celebrating by getting off this dagone internet...eating some granola bars...brushing my teeth...washing my face...working on some homework...events i reserve only for this special day that comes around only once a year...i'm understandably elated...

<!-- break -->

today i have to go into work and take company pictures for an article they are doing on us in the paper...that doesn't sound too bad unless you know where i work...beachy's country chalet...a little podunk amish restaurant in sugarcreek...i need a new job

p.s.- i'm new to this whole thing but if you're my friend (or you think you are)Â and have a xanga site u would like me to link to or whatever...email me and i'll see what i can do...
