i have a confessíon to make: i haven't missed you xanga...

<!-- break -->

i'm officially 24 and have now come to accept the fact that trends have far passed me by...i can see them off in the distance...and every great once in a while someone'll throw a fad my way and i'll feel like i'm up on what's going on...but mostly i just follow in their wake and pick up remnants of what's left of yesterday's scene here and there...

but i've come to accept my place...and i'm generally content with not being cool...take for instance my recent infatuation with wilco...how many years ago did <em>yankee hotel foxtrot</em> come out? many, many years ago i'm sure...but i just now have come to appreciate it...i've done the same with pedro the lion recently...and even <em>blue like jazz</em>...i just finished that one up...it was an enlightening read to say the least...replete with insight into whatever this post-modern, jumbled mess of a christian society we now live in is called...but unfortuately i'm a few years too late...(however, thanks to the newly formed sixforty book club...i'll have a few sorry souls i can share my epiphanies and general uncoolness with)...

viva la revolucíon...

well i guess an update on life is in order...fall semester is nearly over...the huge final project that was given at the beginning of the year is nearly due and is just now finding it's way into some form of a cohesive state...funny how that happens...i received $100 from work for having perfect attendance this past year in addition to my christmas bonus...i guess i'm just you're average working man now...

sixforty will be in it's new room by the beginning of the year...the only thing holding us back is about $10,000 worth of sound gear...i've decided to name the worship band "sixforty racket" to keep in harmony with 180 recently dubbing themselves "180 noise"...hey, what can i say...i thought it was witty...craig and i have also been filming the first of what we hope to be many short films for sixforty under the tentative moniker "faux reel productions"...i asked for a dv camera for christmas...so we'll see where that goes...

that should keep you all covered for the next month or so before i post again...

until then...adíos xanga-migos...
