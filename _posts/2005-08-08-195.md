rejoice...ryan finally has new music to listen to...in the form of the new death cab and switchfoot albums...and the world is spinning in 6/8 time once again...or maybe if we're feeling crazy...7/8 time...

<!-- break -->

so this past weekend was a blast...a blast from the past even...friends from all corners of the nation convened at <a href="http://www.xanga.com/dreamerswell" target="_new">dave's</a> for a summer's end extravaganza of sorts...but i'm in denial about summer sputterin' and dying out soon...so we'll just call it the "eternal 7 o'clock summer bash"...and that for very good reason...nights like those need to learn to never end...

however...one thing that <em>will</em> be ending soon is the layout to this website...i can hardly stand to visit it myself...so i can't imagine what you all face everytime you actually drum up enough willpower to click that little button that sends you spinning towards this dreadfully awful site...well, soon my friends...soon you will have many new stunning visuals to delight your cyber-self with...thank goodness...

i can't sit digitally still...

tomorrow = six:forty...wednesday = band practice...thursday = coldplay...friday = the world...

i like referring to ryan in the third person...
