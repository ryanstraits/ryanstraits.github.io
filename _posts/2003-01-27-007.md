listening to: paloalto - heroes and villians [01 - world outside of you]

there are now more than six billion people inhabiting this planet today...we as humans have no comprehension of that number [6 x 10^9]...and sometimes it's hard to believe that there is just one person out there among all those masses that is perfect for you...what are the odds of finding them?...1 in 6,000,000,000...the task seems daunting and utterly discouraging...how do you know when (and if) you eventually fall in love that that person is "the one person" that is meant for you? what if you find someone but don't realize that there is another person far better fitted for you but lives halfway around the world and you'll never meet them?...it's kinda crazy to think about...and don't think i think about this all the time...i brought this up as a result of a conversation w/ three of my friends [who just so happen to be girls] about weddings last nite...most girls would say that they have planned their weddings out already...most guys barely think about it...in fact last nite was really one of the first times i honestly tried to visualize it...but how can we when the face at the end of the aisle is blurry?...i guess i just have to keep reminding myself that i will never find her...how could i ever? the odds are definitely not in my favor...i just have to keep resting in that fact that a higher power is taking care of all that and will simply show me the way to her when the proper time arrives...hmmm...maybe God can plan the wedding as well...

last nite was good fun...not because of the superbowl, mind you...but because of all the festivities that surround the "big game"...i played some "fake" poker [or should i say watched guys play "fake" poker and occasionally slipped them chips when they were having a few bad hands]...and then later i became wrapped up in several close games of "tecmo super bowl"...which has to be one of the greatest games in all of video-game history...you just can't beat the original...just plain classic...

tonite i'll be attending another exciting night of class and then off to worship team practice and then hopefully somewhere to watch tonite's episode of "joe millionaire"...who knows what that idiot will say tonite...or even worse, what the girls will do to impress him...it's gonna be hilarious no matter how you cut it...
