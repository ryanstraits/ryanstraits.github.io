<span style="font-family:Verdana;">three posts in three days...a small miracle has occurred...</span>

well the foam drone has returned home after an eight-hour mental slumber at the plant...

today i thought about how sad i am that i cannot go to cornerstone this year...it would take another small miracle for me to be able to go...what with my new job and the 3 camps i'm leading worship at it just isn't gonna work out...and that really bums me out...i'm gonna miss the endless dust...the horrible stink coming from the line of porta-jon's...jeen and his blue hair...the goth tent...bathing twice a week...the 10 hour drive out and then coming back in the middle of the night..."i'm so hardcore i'll light your grill on fire"...trying to catch two bands that are playing the same timeslot on different stages...watchin' joe fall down the hill by the main stage...generator shows...sleepin' in the back of my truck...that one man who blasts stryper from his stereo while riding his bike...getting woke up by soundchecks on the mainstage...and many other great memories...if you have any to add feel free to post them via your comments...

i guess there's always next year...
