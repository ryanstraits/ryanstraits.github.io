and the dust settles on yet another day...

<!-- break -->

isn't funny how our days are set up? how sleeping is like the "reset" button to our lives? our thoughts and actions from the day then get transferred from our short term memories to our long term ones...why is it that my time here at work drags on but my time off the clock just flies right by? sometimes i wish that i had a few longer days to offset these seemingly shorter days...the days that before i know it i'm in bed and the events that are so fresh in my conscience are beginning to acquiesce into the long term...the beginning of that ever so slow shift to the back of my mind...

wake up...work...live...reset...

<em>*click...fizz...ahhh...a sip of my non-caloric caffeinated beverage and all is right with the world once again...*</em>

so i woke up this morning and had a slight pain in my neck...not unusual for myself...if i sleep too long my back starts to hurt so i figured it was something of that sort (although i can never seem to sleep long enough on work days that's for sure)...however, i get here to work and i go to crack my neck and instantly i'm in a world of hurt...and believe me it's not a very enjoyably habitable world...yah see, now i can't turn my head to the right without pain going down my shoulder and through my arm...when i walk i have to concentrate on keeping my head straight...because it's naturally leaning to the left now...oh this is lovely stuff right here...and so very limiting to work functionality...i can only sit in one position now...straight up and down...head slightly cocked to the left...

so tonite's six:forty...it's acoustic nite once again as we have no drummer...i'm actually really excited for it though...we were forced to go acoustic for the most part at the retreat this weekend and it ended up going just swimmingly...everyone seemed to like it too...tonite we've reworked a few tunes and they're shaping up to sound mighty dandy...God's been doing some kool stuff in the worship department despite all the inconsistency...he's been proving himself faithful to provide just what we need, when we need it...and that's all that he promised he'd do...can't ask for more than that...

<em>reset...</em>
