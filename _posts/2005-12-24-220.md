###merry xmas and a happy x year...

is it just me or is this whole making sure everyone remembers dec. 25th is christmas getting a little out of control?

<!-- break -->

i think jesus remembers it's his birthday...even though it isn't actually his real birthday...and who even says he makes that big a deal out of it anyways? maybe he just waves it off like so many of us do after we get over 40...or 2,000...heck i would too if most of the world went on celebrating my day of birth without me...

i think the point is...those who love christ remember the true reason of christmas and appreciate why the day was set aside in the first place no matter what everyone feels like they have to "correctly" call it...if the rest of the world decides they just want their "holidays to be happy" or simply want to "greet their season"...then so be it...maybe their fingers got so tired from typing all those christmas cards that they needed to shorten a few words down to appease their carpal tunnel...and really...."xmas" sounds a whole heck of a lot better than "christx"...so let's give'm that much...

anyways...all that to say...let's first remember to make for a merry christmas in our own lives...instead of trying so hard to force one on everyone else...

here's to hoping your yuletide's gay...
