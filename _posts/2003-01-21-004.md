listenin' to: gary jules - mad world (donnie darko soundtrack)

eatin': choc. chip cookie dough ice cream and a tall cool glass o' milk

<!-- break -->

a fairly uneventful day today...why can't i ever motivate myself to doing anything creative? i did find much enjoyment in watching "joe millionaire" tonite w/ about 9 other single guys...that has got to be one of the funniest shows on tv right now...watching those girl's reactions to such a complete idiot that they think is loaded is hilarious...

so saturday i moved all my guitars, keyboard and all my other musical gear into the corner of my basement so that i can have it all in one place and stop thoroughly annoying my family w/ my playing...hopefully the bleak, dark environment will be somewhat inspiring...

take note: i will never be available at 12am and 1pm ever again...macgyver is back...and he's back to stay...i haven't been this happy since the fourth grade...the last time it was on...

tomorrow's only two high points will consist of: a new, undoubtedly amazing episode of smallville and what will most likely be a very challenging and uplifting evening w/ the koolest singles group around, 640...i can't wait

even the pope is hardcore now...and you thought ghandi was a radical...
