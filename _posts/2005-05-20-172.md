this weekend is the big push...

<!-- break -->

for only the second time in my life i'm moving...i've lived in our current home for 17 years...aka 74% of my life...so this will be kind of a big deal...

my parents have built a new house on the outskirts of sugarcreek...and over the past few months i've just been so darn excited about getting outta this side of town...aka "the dark side"...i won't have to deal with stupid tourists...amish buggies...or any of that crap on this side of town...plus our new house is pretty killer...i'm getting my own little pad in the basement...with my own entrance 'n everything...i'm gonna be getting alot of cool new furniture for my room very soon...i even have a little area reserved to set up all my musical gear...it'll be stellar i say...just stellar...

but now...as we're getting ready to haul everything over this weekend...i'm finding my state to be somewhat melancholic...it's all so bittersweet...i'm excited about the new house...my new room...the new location...but man...i'm leaving my childhood home...this blasted place i've lived in for the better part of my life...the place i've come to hate over the past few years because of it's distance from just about everything else i do besides work...but this is where i've lived...this has been my home...

it's probly going to feel like i'm on vacation for the first few weeks...because it's strange yah know...this whole idea of how we can move "home" from one place to another...

this weekend i will begin defaulting to a new location...

<em>lights will guide you home...ignite your bones...and i will try to fix you...</em>
