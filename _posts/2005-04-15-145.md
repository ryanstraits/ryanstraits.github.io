<strong>10 drawbacks of working in a cubicle:</strong>

1. being told to "think outside the box" when i'm in the darn box all day...

2. not being able to check e-mail attachments without first seeing who is behind me...

3. fabric cubicle walls do not offer much protection from any kind of gun fire...

4. that nagging feeling that if i just press the right button, i will get a piece of cheese...

5. lack of roof rafters for the noose...

6. the walls are too close together for my hammock to work right...

7. co-workers tend to stare when i take my pants off...

8. 23 power cords, 1 outlet...

9. prison cells are not only bigger, they have beds...

10. can't slam the door if i decide to quit and walk out...
