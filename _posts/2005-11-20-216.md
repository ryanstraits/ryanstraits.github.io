well i guess i can't use the excuse of never having time to update...

<!-- break -->

i don't know why i save doing homework for sundays...there's football on sundays...and watching football beats doing homework like 9 times out of 10...i'll save that one time for when i'm feeling really inspired...oh and if there aren't any good games on...

so this week is a short one...all thanks to the fan-friendly "thanks 'n giving" weekend...my goal is to actually try to be thankful for something this year...i'm sure many can relate...thanksgiving usually only means alot of eating...seeing family i barely know...and well...more football...

i'm pretty sure that it wasn't intended to be a selfish holiday...but i'm pretty sure it goes by every year and i rarely spend a lick of it thinking about anyone but my myself...shame on me...

on that note...here's just a few things i'm thankful for this year:
<ul>
	<li>my family being reunited for an entire week...</li>
	<li>all of those i've had the privilege of being close friends with over the years...</li>
	<li>those who made it a point to say a few kind words to me around my birthday...</li>
	<li>old friends coming in from out of town...</li>
	<li>all of the heartbreaking moments God has brought me closer to himself through...</li>
	<li>the truly amazing human beings that have invested in me...</li>
	<li>another year that God allows me to play music in some form...</li>
	<li>and finally...everyone who leaves me a comment on this entry...</li>
</ul>
well...i'm still working on that selfish part...and now...back to football...
