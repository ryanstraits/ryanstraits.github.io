so i haven't written in a while...deal with it...i'm a busy guy...or so i'd like to think...i was supposed to work at my new job all this weekend...but apparently production was down last week and so they didn't need my services...and i was all psyched and ready to work hard too...so i have another weekend off...yippee

so i get a call yesterday from the branch telling me i'm 1 credit short of graduating this spring...i was not amused...so right now i am sitting in a workshop that will span the course of three of my valuable saturday afternoons to make up that 1 credit hour that i need...apparently they didn't catch the fact that i was a credit short when i submitted my application for graduation 2 months ago...so here i am, 2 months away from graduation, scurrying to get everything in line to receive that all-important piece of paper that will further my advancement up the workforce pay-scale...

tonite i am heading up to akron to catch lovedrug and a host of irrevelant other bands...should make for a good time...and with lovedrug i'm poised for nothing less than pure amazement...
