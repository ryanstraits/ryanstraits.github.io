there is a strange new freshness to life...is it the fact that we're in the midst of summer and i'm giddy with glee because of it? the fact that six:forty is switching to a new (and far superior location)? is it my new parking space at work? or have i just become inebriated by the bag of dark chocolates that i have been gnawing on all day? maybe it's better off a mystery...

so i confess...i'm a california addict...since i've been back i have been in withdrawal...especially with all this darn humidity lately...i can't take the heat...i can't take the cold...i need moderation...i'm just a creature of weather-related stability that's all...

so i had a wonderful 3-day weekend, albeit somewhat taxing...sat. nite we ascended the holy hills surrounding new phila to the levitts house to watch the glorious new phila fireworks...sun. nite we gathered at our church grounds to kill ourselves with competitive sports...i not being much of a "sporter" and not in the greatest of shape decided that i would participate in just about every game offered...we engaged in some ultimate frisbee, volleyball and dodgeball...monday i avoided waking up thinking that my body would most likely want to cease from any and all form of movement...but i actually felt pretty good...so i thought...why not try to destroy my body even further...i then accompanied my family and a few friends down to salt fork for a day on the boat...all in all it was pretty fun...the skiing was pretty good...but now i am paying the consequences from my adventurous weekend...i've been deathly tired and sore these past few days...and just when i get back to normality...it will be the weekend once again...

so by the end of this month i will lose two more of my closest friends...and both of them to the wide, wonderful southern state of georgia...i just know they're both gonna meet lovely georgian girls with those cute southern drawls...they'll get married and then build a log cabin in the woods...they'll start playing banjo and smoke a corncob pipe...oh wait...that's my own fantasy...well, i'm still gonna miss those two guys...i had a great time with both of them out in cali but neither of them listened to me as i tried to force them to move out there with me...oh well...i guess if i'm to leave this podunk town it's gonna have to be for God's reasons and not my own now...although, with all my friends moving away...it is making my decision of whether or not to pack up and move out west a whole lot easier...hmmm....
