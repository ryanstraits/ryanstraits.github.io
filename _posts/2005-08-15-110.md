my baby sister left for college today...

she's the straits who actually did it...she left this town (and even the state)...and for that i am truly proud of her...she did what the two siblings before her only dreamed of doing...leaving everything familiar and venturing off own her own...

it took courage and i respect her greatly for it...but i'm really gonna miss her...for the first time inÂ 18 years we won't be under the same roof...for 18 years the straits family has been complete and intact...but just like that...one is gone...and nothing'll be the same again...it can't be...my lil sis's room is empty...

i remember as a kid always wondering what it would be like when us three kids were all grown up...when we were past all the annoyin', fightin', bickerin' stages (at least for the most part) and into full blown adulthood...well, here we are now...and besides having two really killer fashion consultants...i also have two really great friends in them both...definitely more than i had expected out of us three...

so all that to say...i'm really gonna miss you beeps...and i love yah and will be praying for yah...

take care of yourself...and i'll be down to visit soon...
