ahh spring break...my old friend...

<!-- break -->

i think all i need now is some form of a spring break from working...yea i guess they have those now...they're called paid vacation days...and i have accrued a nice 'lil stack of about ten of 'em this year...but the more of them i get the more i feel like just holding onto them (i'm quite the packrat)...i just want to hord them all in a corner and bury them or something...just doesn't seem right to spend so much of a great thing...

but i'm sure i'll be using plenty of them as summer comes around...and my legs get restless and feel the need to roam around a little bit...there are many possibilities for summer travel this year...i'm kicking it all off with a pit stop in hottlanta in a few weeks for a friends wedding...then hilton head with the folks in may...and from there on is anybody's guess...maybe seattle to see a few old friends...maybe london to visit with yet more friends...or what about a roadtrip...yes yes...there's always room for that...

and though i have all these plans...how many i actually capitalize on is a whole other story...like this coming week off from school...i have many things planned that i've been wanting to get done since my (abbreviated) christmas break...yea where did that go...so let's just hope that i'm somewhat motivated and get things done while i have the freedom of a clear mind for a few days (fyi: one of those things high on the list is putting some much needed life back into this measly site)...

it's funny to sit back and think about things...life hasn't really changed...in fact...surrounding circumstances are much the same...usually a good sign that maybe i'm the one who's doing the changing...

these sunny outlooks on life are heavily underrated...
