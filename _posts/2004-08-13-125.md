<em>"it doesn't matter when you get here...just what time..."</em>

this is going to be a rather dull and unrelated entry...but it will just have to do as this is all my creativity can drum up right now...

<!-- break -->

watched a few episodes of strangers w/ candy last nite while i riffled through and reorganized my cd collection last nite...it had been reduced to a clutter of discs in the back seat of my car...so it was high time to get those in order...which gave me a good chance to sit back and watch one of the funniest satirical comedies to come down the pipes at comedy central in a long, long time...my friend josh let me borrow this dvd a good while ago and last night was the first time i actually sat down and just started watching each episode in order...for anyone who hasn't seen swc i do believe all three seasons are out on dvd...i highly recommend all of them...i know that was a bland summary of the show and gives you no pertinent info about it whatsoever...i bet it wasn't even enough to peak your interest...yeah, well...i'm not your personal-reviewer-man...so deal with it...

so...besides the pure delight of watching swc, last night as a whole was pretty enjoyable...my mom and i went out to dinner at the quaint, little restaurant my younger sister <a href="http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=Secrets_held_in" target="_blank">alisa</a> works at...the food was excellent and the atmosphere was warm...at that moment i was happy to be living in this idyllic rural area...everyone was friendly...everyone said hello...it was just a pleasant experience...we then proceeded to andreas furniture to look at some possibilities for our new house's "great room"...i hope that we also decide to put a "little room" in the house to balance things out some...that's the key to interior design...equilibrium and symetrics...or it would be if i was an interior designer...which i am not...with my luck though...said "little room" will end up being my own...

so now in hopes of livening up this already vapid entry...

<em>i bring to you now a new segment of my xanga...</em>

<em>[i often think about what are occupying peoples minds when i drive past them on the road...all we catch are glimpses of these people and see only a moment of time in their lives...most we'll never see again...inside those cars is a whole other world going on outside our own...so, when i'm driving i like to make up what i believe our friends on the other side of the yellow line are thinking at that very moment...]</em>

<em>so without further ado...i present you with:</em>

<strong>thoughts of a passerby</strong>

"i can't believe no one makes body kits for my geo metro...don't tell me this thing ain't sweet..."

"i believe 15 mph is an acceptable rate of speed in a 25 mph zone..."

"i know our religion forbids driving cars...but i'm pretty sure God doesn't mind if i drive my tractor around on the roads...i mean it only takes up like 3 car lengths...and can top out at like 17 mph..."

---

that concludes today's entry...tonight i'm hanging out w/ my long lost friend <a href="http://www.xanga.com/elaineraemast" target="_blank">elaine</a> who moved to seattle many moons ago...should be a good time...but i'm not gonna stop buggin' her til she introduces me to her friend that's on "amish in the city"...that's right...she's friends with a reality show tv star...i'm giddy with glee...

did anyone else notice that it's friday the 13th??...i may have to stay up all night and watch jason movies like we used to in days of yore...

eeeeck...
