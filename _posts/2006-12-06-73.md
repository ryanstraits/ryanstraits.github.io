ok...so i've given some serious thought as to whether i want to resurrect this site or not...

and i still haven't come to a conclusion yet...i'll be done with school (forever) this next week...

*pause* wooooot wooooot!

*unpause*...so free time will once again become an option...but over this past year i've learned alot about the power of words being left unsaid...it's been a year full of high's and low's (a.k.a. a whole lot to talk and/or blog about)...and so i think it's probably been better that i've steered away from here more often then not...

i've also rung up a whole long list of things i've been dying to do but haven't had the time to because of school (and well...everything else)...so i hope to be giving that list my undivided attention here very shortly...and i truly cannot wait...

so hopefully...you won't see me on here...
