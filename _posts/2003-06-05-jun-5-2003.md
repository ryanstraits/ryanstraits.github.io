<span style="font-family:Verdana;">ok so i'm back folks...i've been pretty busy w/ my new job 'n all...it's been going great...while i hate to think of the fact that i've settled into a "real" job and that i could be there the rest of my life (that's a pretty long time if you think about it)...it's been good to get some structure to my life, getting my evenings free and having peace of mind in knowing that i've got a stable job that i like doing...no more job search!...what a relief that is...so thanks to all you kids out there who were thinking/praying for me...it means alot...</span>

so besides work this has been a crazy week all the way around...over the weekend i got to hang out w/ my good friends <a href="http://www.xanga.com/dreamerswell" target="_new">dave</a> and elaine who i haven't seen in a good long while...it was great to see them but i'm sad it was only for one night...elaine is going back to seattle, dave is going there for the summer as well...and then my bud <a href="http://www.xanga.com/averagejoe" target="_new">joe</a> is taking off on tour w/ <a href="http://www.isaacimprov.com" target="_new">isaac</a> once again...i will miss them all dearly...

next tuesday night i'm going to see coldplay!...i hope...

capitol g: you've given me hope for a better tomorrow...
