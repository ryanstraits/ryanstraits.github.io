as the saying goes: "if you ain't got nothing nice to say...don't say nothing at all"...

and so i haven't...

i hope to post more on life and it's twists and turns soon..."Lord willing and the creek don't rise"...

but such meaningless things will have to wait...for now my thoughts and prayers are consumed around news of the passing of an old friend...

"this life is but a vapor"...
