it's 12:59am and no one is on...the internet is a ghost town...

so far this week has been killer...i've been able to hang w/ my long lost bud chad most of the week and yesterday josh, him and i got to jam a little bit...it was so good to play again...it's been well over a year since we have played as "litwik"...some of our friends came over to watch us fiddle around...they requested some of our older stuff and we tried to do them justice but we were pretty rusty...we worked on a new tune that we think is pretty tight...although we don't know when we'll be able to finish it...

tonite was officially my last nite at pro-foam and i couldn't be happier...i'm gonna miss the good times i had there and all the great people i worked with but most definitely will not miss factory work or the evil foam beads that follow me home every night...

i cannot take this digital silence...it's 1:39am and all that is left of me is a vague cyber-shadow...</td>
