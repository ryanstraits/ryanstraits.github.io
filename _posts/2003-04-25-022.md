listening to: pete yorn - long way down

<!-- break -->

school is winding down and so as a result stress is winding up...this semester hasn't been too bad though so i really can't complain...but since it was a little easier i did get a little complacent unfortunately and now i am paying for it by rushing to get like 4 projects done in the next 2 weeks...yikes...

in other news: the novelty of my new job has officially worn off...i hate the monotony of it...i hate being sore the morning after...i hate the foam beads that i can't ever seem to escape...and most of all i hate how my mind keeps reverting back to work even when i'm not there...however...i do enjoy the fact that even though i am only part-time i am making pretty good money and my bank account is finally showing some positive figures...

i'm really looking forward to this summer...and the possibilities that lie ahead...but i'm also a little anxious because of all the uncertainty w/ school in the fall and my job situation...but i'm starting to see a little glimpse of the future...and it's looking bright...

finally...as i stated a couple posts ago...i'm pretty indifferent on this whole war in Iraq...and i still am...but i recently found this quote that may pick at your brains a little...enjoy:

"Why of course the people don't want war...But after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship...Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger."Â -Hermann Goering, Nazi leader - April 18, 1946 - W.W.II Nuremberg Trials
