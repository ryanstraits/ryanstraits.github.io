Aging is weird.

<!-- break -->

Your thirties reveal that--like some cruel plot twist early in the second act--your body has just been out to betray you all along. It's slowly been switching from your side to the one of some unknowable, unrepentant force of evil. And no matter how hard you try to coax and convince it, it's just not coming back.

Things that you used to enjoy--like sleeping in, eating, showering, and pick-up games of any sport--now become reflections on your fragility.

I can't sleep-in past 8am now without my back feeling like it's going to dislodge a vertebrae. Eating becomes a tally of how many pounds a meal will add to my waistline and how many miles are required to run/bike them off. Showering hits a whole new level of creepiness now as you horrifically gaze in the mirror at this saggier, hairier, alternate-reality version of your 20 year-old-self staring back at you. And this happens everyday.

And, well, you just _hurt_ after any and all prolonged periods of activity.

You hurt a lot.

But obviously, there is a richness to this stage of aging that I've been skirting. For all the fresh wrinkles, new aches, and extra pounds, there's an airy plateau of transcendence that can only be reached once you crest that first hill of your thirties. A plateau that gives you a clearer view of your life and how little of it you actually have left.

I've made it this far and my body is still intact. I still have the majority of my hair (though it's the minority I've lost that bothers me) and some bounce left in my step. What do I have to worry about? Just squeezing every ounce of life out of this old thing that I can in the next 50 years or so, that's all.

It's not rosy but I think having a firm grasp on your finality is a good thing. It makes you try harder, push deeper, and commit more fully. You are much less likely to half-ass your way through life when you have an achy back or a creaky knee constantly reminding you that your body is trending in a downward direction.

In last week's post, I noted an MIT study that claimed our "fluid intelligence" peaked at age 20. If you actually clicked the link and read on from the first few paragraphs, you'd realize that I wasn't entirely being truthful with what I had reported back. Oops.

Yes, some of our cognitive abilities peak when we're younger, but many more are still ascending upwards through our thirties and even into our fifties and sixties. Facial recognition and visual short term memory both peak in your early thirties, says the MIT study. Our vocabulary and the mental skills needed to evaluate other's emotional states peak in our forties and fifties. So that's certainly something to look forward to!

And really, it makes sense, doesn't it? My mind doesn't feel all that old. In fact, it's still on point. Our thirties are the years to take advantage of our superior mental acuity.

Middle age is the unique period of your life when you will actually know more than both your kids _and_ your parents. If there was a bell curve on peak intelligence, your thirties would undeniably be right around the crest. You're probably not going to be more "with it" mentally than you are in your thirties.

This is a gift, my friends, and we would do well to take advantage.

Now, I know there will be folks several years my senior that will no doubt scoff at a 36-year-old complaining about feeling old. I get it. I know I have plenty of aging, aches, and probably pounds left ahead of me.

But I think that if you polled a few individuals down the road a ways, and asked them to recall what age range they first started to feel the full force of aging, I'm pretty certain the consensus would be:

Your thirties are definitely when you start to feel _old_.

Next, we'll take a look at a Grown Up Soul. It's kind of like an old soul, but cooler.
