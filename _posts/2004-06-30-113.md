i'm back from the excursion to the west coast...and oh was it glorious...i am in love with it out there...not so much in love with everything being 5 times the price than everywhere else in the us (except new york and hawaii...and maybe florida...and well...everywhere but ohio...and wyoming)...but that's just the price of love i guess...

<!-- break -->

well the trip went great...i hope to post a few pics in the coming days...we got in to san diego sunday nite and then headed down to mexico monday...camped on the beach and hung out w/ high schoolers til wednesday and then we headed back to san diego...thursday we went up to the oc and la...friday we hit the hotspots in san diego and then headed home saturday...it was quite a whirlwind trip but i think God spoke to each of us all in our own way...between this trip and the albania trip he has been showing me so much about what it means to follow him and abandoning myself in the process...it's been an amazing journey...and maybe in my next few entries i'll expound on it more...

so i've now been to the oc...while i was there i gave my pal seth a call and we were gonna grab some seafood on the pier...but unfortunately i didn't have enough time...he's a busy guy too...i guess he sailed to tahiti this summer because he felt lonely...crazy kid...he's real dramatic like that sometimes...i think they should put his life on a tv show...it's that dramatic...i guess that's california life for yah though...

in movie news: spiderman 2 got 4 stars at tvguide.com...they rarely dole out 4 stars on any movie...not even titanic achieved such high marks from them (totally random factoid: we saw the studios where they shot titanic just off the mexican coast)...so to hand 4 stars out to a summer blockbuster let alone a sequel to a comic book remake is a pretty big thing for them...i hope it can live up to the hype...i know that if it's anything like the soundtrack it's bound to be good...in other movie news: michael moore made $23.9 million off the war in iraq...oh and the whole bit about titanic not getting 4 stars was a joke...and so are michael moore's movies for that matter...

good day all...

props to my baja chums: doc, cheech, z, the brit, crispy, and the welterweight...
