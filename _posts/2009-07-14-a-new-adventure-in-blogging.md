<p>in the hopes of keeping things fresh(er) on this site, i'm launching a new little page on here i'm calling "<a href="/notes-to-self">notes to self</a>" (see top bar for the page conveniently titled, "notes").</p>
<p>in it will be short blurbs that i think of throughout the day that aren't quite 1,000 word post worthy. some might be funny, others might attempt to be funny but fall horrifyingly short. i guess you'll be the judge.</p>
<p>until my next ridiculously long entry...</p>
