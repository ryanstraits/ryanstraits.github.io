In the hopes of keeping things fresh(er) on this site, I'm launching a new little page on here I'm calling "Notes-To-Self" (see top bar for the page conveniently titled, "Notes").

In it will be short blurbs that I think of throughout the day that aren't quite 1,000 word post worthy. Some might be funny, others might attempt to be funny but fall horrifyingly short. I guess you'll be the judge.

Until my next ridiculously long entry...

*Editor's note: These are lost to antiquity. Nothing to see here anymore.*
