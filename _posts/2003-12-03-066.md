what a great, relaxing and absolutely refreshing weekend i had...i got to eat alot, sleep in, watch movies, and hang out w/ my family and old friends...gotta love four-day weekends...especially when those weekends are over a holiday such as thanksgiving...

<!-- break -->

however, this week it's back to the grindstone...it felt like a freight train hit me on monday and i haven't recovered quite yet...sleepin in for four straight days is nice but really messes yah up for the next week when you're back to waking up at 6:45...one good thing is that this is my last week of classes and next week is finals...for some strange reason i'm not stressing out about that right now...i don't know if that's good or bad...i guess i shall find out...

last nite i rooted through some journal-type/stream of consciousness writing i did last summer...i really wanna get back into it again...hopefully when school's done i'll have time to do it at the end of my days...i greatly enjoy going back through those and reading what i was thinking at that time and seeing how much i've changed and grown since then...maybe if you're lucky i'll post some of those thoughts i had (they're quite good and pretty funny at times) in my xanga for my next entry...

you can only hope...
