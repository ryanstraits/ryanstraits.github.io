uhoh...added a freaky new pic...decided it was time for a change...whether it was a change for the better i know not...how about some feedback?...i was trying to go for the whole 70's album cover look on it and that's how it turned out...i'm quite strange...Â 

<!-- break -->

one quick neato tidbit for you kids to take home with you...if any of you have seen vince gill's video for "someday" (which i'm sure that will be very few of you)...you will notice at the very end when the girl is making a fire on the beach that the scenery in the background very closely matches the picture i have below...that's because i have been to that same beach on the island of kauai in hawaii and i took this picture from about the same spot that the chick is cookin' up that little fire...well at least i think it's pretty kool...but if that's not good enough for you than you'll all be happy to know that this same beach is very near to the hippie town of hanalei...which you all may recognize from the song "puff the magic dragon", which was written there...i always knew it was a drug song...
