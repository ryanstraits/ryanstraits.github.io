let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter (or just the weekend, let's say):

<!-- break -->

i finally got the david crowder cd...ol' mr. walton came through in the end...but yea, it's quite good...a bit more epic in nature...takes a while to get into the groove...but that crowder man is one quirky fellow (and eclectic too...covering sufjan stevens? who would have guessed?)...you gotta hand it to him for putting a fresh spin on what's becoming an incredibly dry genre...

the swiss festival is in the books for 2005...but hopefully not for good...it was good to see old friends and familiar faces...even if there was no verbal communication with them all...it's just nice to know that i'm not the only loser still drawn to this thing year after year...

this weekend i learned that random acts of kindness don't have to be so random after all...and that endeavoring to be real and authentic doesn't require that you always have to hate your life (although it has been a while since i've smiled as my head hits the proverbial pillow)...yea, things aren't particularly great...but joy comes from living above your petty circumstances...happiness is just the result of that off chance that things actually go the way you hoped they would...i'm sick of feeling down on life...it's too short to not live it to it's fullest...

there's so much that i would change...but fall is here...and life is good...

oh yea and i got a raise at work...
