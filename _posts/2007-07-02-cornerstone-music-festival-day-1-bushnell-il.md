so after the big heist in kc we decided not to stay at that same house another night (obviously)...we all piled in to the house the other half of the bands stayed at the night before which was the home of our friends aaron and andrea...they were very hospitable to us and we thank them for it...<br /><br />we then got up the next day (thursday, june 28) and headed for cornerstone music festival in bushnell,  il...it was about a 5-6 hour drive from kc...we ended up taking off a little later than we were hoping and didn't get to see a few of the bands i had wanted to catch...thursday had the best lineup of artists that i personally enjoy...we missed page france but got to catch most of rosie thomas...starflyer 59 played next and i caught a little of them...i wasn't very impressed w/ his (it's really just one guy) live show and so i roamed around and checked out a few other bands...most of them hardcore (that's really all c-stone is turning into anymore)...but i also met up with my good friend colleen who was working the merch table for cool hand luke and the myriad...so that was cool...<br /><br />chris practically knew everyone at cornerstone...he told alot of bands he knew there to plug all of our shows which was very cool...discover america got an impromptu slot on a newer stage called "the anchor stage" so he was happy for that...he didn't have one going into the festival...starflyer even allowed him to jump up on stage during their set to plug his show and twjr and state bird's shows as well...<br /><br />we threw together a makeshift campsite made up of a tarp on the ground and another tarp suspended between our car and van (we didn't have alot of room to pack camping supplies for the whole tour)...i posted some pics of it and other events to the flickr page...it's quite a site and made for a fairly uncomfortable night...but it's cornerstone and we all expected that coming in...one thing that was unusually comfortable was the temperature...i always remember cornerstone as being very hot and steamy...but this time the weather was pretty cool and bearable...<br /><br />i personally went to c-stone back in 2001 and 2002 with a group of my friends but went only as a spectator...i haven't been able to make it out since due to my job but have held out hope that one day i could make it back...so it's definitely a dream come true to not only be attending c-stone once again but to actually be playing it as well...
