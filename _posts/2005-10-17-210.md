just to let you all know ("you all" = those of you who think i'm incomparably lazy when it comes to this xanga site)...this particular entry was started last thursday...but as most things go with me...i never got around to finishing it...

<!-- break -->

lately, chad and i have been absolutely obsessed with that g-d monopoly game at mcee-dee's...since i'm trying to keep my boyish figure, i've just been going through the drive-thru for large diet sody's...and just like that...*boom*...two points for me...i believe this is how gambling addictions start...but all i need is mediterranean avenue and i've got myself an freegin' ipod...c'mon...how sick would that be?...and i don't even say sick...the other day chad got a chicken sangwich...two large fries and a large diet...that's 8 pieces total, folks...sick...

so who wants to sit through a 3 hour manufacturing class tonite after sitting through 8 mind-numbing hours of work?...*blank stares*...anyone?...*deafening silence*...bueller?...yea me neither...but apparently i'm an adult now and these are the type of things we do...responsibility...what's that?

my agent just called...apparently, that episode of "10 years younger" i was on aired today...hopefully you all set your tivo's...next stop: my own home renovation show...
