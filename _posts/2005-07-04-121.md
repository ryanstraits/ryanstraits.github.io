<strong><span style="color:#cc9966;font-size:small;">the four best things about the fourth of the july</span></strong>

1. when i woke up around 9am i had already earned myself an hour's worth of wages...

2. roman candle wars...

4. the fact that when i go into work tomorrow...i'll be one day closer to the weekend...

<strong>bonus:</strong> did i mention i got paid to sleep in? i just can't get over the unmigitated joy that paid holidays bring...
