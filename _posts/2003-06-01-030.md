packt like sardines in a crushd tin box....

<!-- break -->

but it was worth it...we were not even 50 ft. back from the stage in the packed out tower city amphitheater...coldplay was amazing...however good they are on their cd they are that much and better live...i would of paid the $35 to get in just to see chris martin flail around on the stage like he did...i kept wondering why i hadn't tried harder to catch one of their shows earlier until they announced that this was their first ever show in cleveland...how sad that we have been depraved of such stellar concerts here in craptown, ohio...hope you all have the chance to see them if they ever venture back this way again...they are a must see...

unfortunately my friend ang got sick during their first song and had to go puke for a while in the back...she got lots of attention but missed one of her favorite bands up close...how sad...however, the rest of us (my buds <a href="http://www.xanga.com/unsubscribe" target="_blank">aaron</a> and <a href="http://www.xanga.com/hottperson" target="_blank">emily</a>) endured the annoying drunks, potheads and flat-out idiots (including one girl who thought it was acceptable to grab my butt at one point in the show) to enjoy what we would call one of our favorite concert experiences ever...

work has been pretty dull this week...i keep having to find things for myself to do...which is nice since i don't have other people telling me what to do...except for the fact that i still barely know what i'm doing there so i really can't give myself much to do without someone else's approval first...however, today for lunch i unexpectedly crossed paths w/ my friends cyndi and steph at mcdonalds so i sat and had lunch w/ them...what a pleasant surprise...

tonight i have to do laundry and other homely-type things seeing as my dad and i are on our own all this week while my sis's are at camp and my mom is in florida...next week i'll be all by myself as everyone in my family but me is going on vacation...oh well...party at my place...

"stood on the edge...tied to a noose...then you came along...and you cut me loose"
