i've come to realize that for some reason i am feeling the need to make an entry about once a week now...and in just about every entry i talk about what i did on the weekend...this entry shall be no different...the reason being my weekdays are long and filled w/ work/school/ and other lines on my schedule that i would rather not bore you with...i was also down and out w/ a pesky cold all last week...thrilling, i know...

<!-- break -->

so on that note i give you my weekend: saturday i played my first-ever game of frisbee golf up in canton...what fun it was...we played in teams...it was curve and i against my buds joel and sam...although we gave it our best effort josh and i came up 1 stroke short in the end...we were pleased as punch that we even did that good (how can punch be pleased by the way?)...sat. nite i had the whole gang over for poker night...i had a rough start but won some big hands near the end to even up...i can't wait to play again...

sunday afternoonÂ i was mesmerized once again by the lovely audrey hepburn...i had several things that i should have done but instead i fell prey to her spell and spent the whole afternoon watching such old flicks as: "breakfast at tiffany's" (the movie not the song), "roman holiday", and "my fair lady"...please don't ask, because i don't know...

"lift up your heads...open the doors...let the King of Glory come in...and forever be our God"
