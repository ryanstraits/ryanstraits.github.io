this weekend went pretty well despite being a little hectic...it was by far my favorite halloween weekend to date (not including the trick or treating days of old...you just can't top those days)...of course last weekend we visited the mansfield reformatory which really set things off for the whole halloween weekend to come...then this fri. nite troy, keith, ryan and i took in "saw" in canton...see the aforementioned review for my thoughts...the whole nite i broke out one of my favorite albums of all time, ok computer, which set a nice haunting mood to the evening as only radiohead can do...

sat. nite a whole bunch of six:forty folks helped out with the 180 youth's haunted trail out on the seilhammer's farm...besides a few mishaps it went off without a hitch (at least my little scene did...the kids later chose ours as their favorite...all thanks to my creepy music, strobe light, and fog machine running abilities of course) and the kids seemed to really enjoy it...this year was pretty much a trial run to see how this type a thing would go over...next year they're going to put much more time and money into it...i can't wait...

here are a few pics of me in makeup...i kinda took the leftovers of the costumes...besides this mime/KISS makeup style i had going on...i also put an old gorilla mask on top (with the gorilla face cut out) so it was just my painted kisser with a whole lot of hair around it...pretty freaky by any means really...
