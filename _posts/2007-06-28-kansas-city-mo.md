<!-- break -->

this was our third time as a band (but only my 2nd time) playing kansas city...it's the home of the winston jazz routine and our's label, the record machine...so they book some really good shows for us here...the place we played at was this cool bar/venue we've played at each time we've been here called "the record bar"...it's always a fun place to play because the sound is top notch there and they also know how to treat band's right with complimentary food and drinks...<br /><br />we didn't have a local opener which probably hurt the turnout somewhat but the show still drew a good bit of people...i'd say more so than when we opened there the last time w/ the starlight mints and minus story...they were both big draws but unfortunately most of those people they drew didn't show up for our 8pm "early" set...this time around the show started at 10pm which was kinda crazy late for a weekday show but there was only us 3 bands and they had an early show at the venue that went from like 7-9pm...discover america went on first because chris wasn't feeling that great and didn't want to play last...we then played second and the winston jazz routine brought up the rear...<br /><br />after the show we split off into two groups because we had two places to stay at...one house was that of a guy named aaron who lives in overland park so coby, ashten, derek, nate phillips &amp; caleb all went there to stay....the rest of us stayed at a guy named seth's house...it was the same place that state bird played a house show at the last time we were in kansas city...it's kind of community type house because alot of people hang out there from time to time...chris and i got to stay in the only air-conditioned room in the house which oddly enough was in the attic...<br /><br />the next day was going to be our first day off on the tour...we were supposed to play a show in springfield, mo which actually sounded like it was going to be very cool but apparently the promoter thought the show was july 27th and not june 27th so he didn't have time to promote it at all...we were all pretty bummed about it but glad to have the extra day to rest up before cornerstone...<br /><br />and then there was our off day...<br /><br />p.s- i finally am on a steady, non-stolen internet connection so i've uploaded a ton of photo's from the last few shows so be sure to go check them out via the "tour photo's" link to the right...
