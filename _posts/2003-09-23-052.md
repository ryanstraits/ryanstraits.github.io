the day is coming: <a href="http://www.kryptonsite.com/" target="_blank">oct. 1st/8pm/WB</a>

<!-- break -->

my heart and mind are clouded with a whole lot of things...decisions to be made, committments to enact, endeavors to pursue...and all i can think about is where i want to eat for lunch today...

had a fairly exciting weekend...started it off with a crash, bang and a boom friday nite when my family went to see "stomp" in cleveland for my dad's b-day...it's my 2nd time seeing them and they were just as amazing as the first time i saw them nearly 6 years ago...if you haven't experienced it you must at some point in your lifetime...they are incredible...

sat. i went to my friend's kev and meagan's wedding...good times there although weddings aren't all that exciting to a young SINGLE guy such as myself...later that nite a bunch of us went to experience the heart and soul of t-county...the fair...we went to watch the rodeo but ended up riding some rides and getting our money's worth instead...i forgot how truly wicked fair rides really are...

sun. nite my friend <a href="http://www.xanga.com/dreamerswell" target="_blank">dave</a> called up and let me know he was in town...we hung out and did such exciting things as eat at taco bell and go to wal-mart...it was good to catch up with him...

this weekend is the official commencement of fall...that's right the swiss festival will be invading the little berg of sugarcreek...and i couldn't be more excited...if you've never been to the 'fest you're seriously missing out...everyone laughs at the idea of the "swiss festival"...polka music, swiss cheese, etc...but growing up going to it every year i can tell you that it is one of the premiere events of the fall and you can't knock it until you've experienced it...so come on out...

<em>"when autumn comes...it doesn't ask...it just walks in...where it left you last...you'd never know when it starts...until there's fog inside the glass around your summer heart..."</em>
