<em>love is in the air tonite...so just breathe...</em>

<!-- break -->

ahhh...valentines day...it has come and gone...although no romantical notions took place for me in any shape or form i did have a fine chance of viewing true love take form in the wedding of my good friends bruno and crisi...i don't think i will ever see a cooler wedding than that one...two wonderful people...both in love with God and with each other...that's true love my friends...that's the only kind of love there is...

i also got the chance this weekend to "love on", as the saying goes, alot of my long-distance friends who were in town for the youth rally at my church...all my boys from michigan as well as my buds chad and aaron from cincy were up and it was great getting to see them all for the brief instances that i did...

six:forty tonite...i'm worn out but i'm sure it will be fun...this week is the last for what was once known as the "late, great worship team"...next week will bring many changes...of which i will be mostlyÂ in charge of...that my friends is scary...but very exciting at the same time...keep me in your prayers as i prepare to take on the enormous task, but at the same time the incredible privilege, of leading God's people in the worship of His holy name...

well i have alot more to say but alas my time has run out as it often does...

<em>breathe...my spirit...breathe...</em>
