the world seems much brighter now...

<!-- break -->

well it could just be the fact that i got new contacts today...went to the eye doctor and talked to him about laser eye surgery...i'd like to get it done through his office and leave my precious eyeballs to someone i trust...but geez it's just so gosh darn expensive...it'll end up being over $3k if i go through his office...a friend of mine got hers done at a place in canada and it only cost her around $800...i priced what my prescription would cost there and it would be roughly $1500...still too darn much...but half of what it would be around here...that definitely puts me in the proverbial pickle...i really want to get it done BAD...and i do think it'll be worth the money...it's just a matter of how much money that extra assurance in having someone you trust walk you through is worth...

when i think of crossing the border to get it done in a slam-bam job i can only think of that crazy eye-switching surgery that tom cruise's character got done in <em>minority report...</em>and that's just very unnerving to say the least...remember that scene when he drops his eyeballs and they go rolling down the walkway...and doesn't someone like step on them or something?...yikes...so...what to do...what to do...man if it wasn't for them darn canadians and their socialist medicinal practices...it'd make my decision a whole lot easier...i just can't come to trust 'em...anyways...in the meanwhile i got myself into soft lenses...yes i am way behind the times and had gas permeables up until this point...and boy life is much better with soft ones i'll tell you that...no longer shall i suffer under the oppressive rule of hard contact lenses...i am free...i am fresh and anew...give me your best, world...i'm ready for you...

so the weekend went pretty good...got to see the el presidente on saturday...me and j.d. were screaming like little girls...and all we saw was him waving out his bus window...i snapped a quick pic with my camera phone and you can't really see ol' gw but he's in there...just waving away...it was kinda of a once in a lifetime thing though i guess...getting to see an active president...even if it was through bulletproof-tinted-bus window glass...and the real kicker is thinking about all the people that saw him drive by on saturday that are gonna vote for him this november just because he drove his motorcade through our one-horse town...it doesn't take much to grab our attention that's for sure...anyways...i'm now convinced that i'm going to become a secret service agent when i get all growed up...or i guess i can just act like i'm that cool now and forget about all the hassle...

saw <em>the village</em> last night...and to be honest i quite enjoyed it...there are many reasons for that...which if you've caught the movie (or don't mind having it spoiled) you can go over to <a href="http://www.xanga.com/weakfingers" target="_blank">andrew's xanga</a> and read my opinion on it in response to his...i think i most enjoyed it because i just love how shyamalan can keep coming up with these well thought out, intriguing movies and still pull them off the way he does...i'll concede that the plot wasn't as strong as some of his previous movies and the twist may not have been as shocking as when we all saw <em>the sixth sense</em> for the first time...but for going in there and knowing his style and what he's going to pull in the end...he did a fine job of setting up the twist and misdirecting the audience as he usually does with beautifually done imagery and top-notch acting...i think i most enjoy shyamalan's work (and this may be to a fault) because i would most like to be able to craft a story and develop a thought all the way through to a finished masterpiece like he does so amazingly...he's an auteur in the purest sense of the word...and i very much wish there were more like him in hollywood...

yes the lovedrug show on friday was amazing...but i'm out of space (and time) to write about it unfortunately...i encourage you all to check them out live and to pick up their album if you get the chance...you won't be disappointed i guarantee you...

that is all for now...
