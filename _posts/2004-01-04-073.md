if that's the case than this is gonna be a pretty long entry...i finally got some pics developed yesterday so i thought i'd post a few for you all to take a gander at...they're from a whole bunch of different events this past fall/winter so don't freak out at my different hair colors and lengths (although any input on what length you do like my hair would really help me out right now as i'm pondering which way to go with it)...so anyways, knock yourself out with these kool pics of me and my friends...

christin'sÂ 3rd annual x-mas party...

well that's all i got for now...i apologize that the quality isn't the greatest on them...xanga saps a good bit of quality when you host them on their servers for some reason...what a load of crap...this premium thing isn't all it's cracked up to be so far...

have a great 4th day of the 1st month of the 4th year of the 21st century...
