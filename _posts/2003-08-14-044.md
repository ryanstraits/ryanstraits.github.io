listening to: saves the day - in reverie

i guess xanga blew up over the weekend...sucks to be them...that being said, i was going to post this on sat. nite but couldn't until now...

<!-- break -->

last week was probably one of the koolest camp experiences i've ever had...i was counting the other day and realized that i have been to over 20 camps in my lifetime...about 7 or so of those i have led/helped lead the worship at...last week was especially kool because we did the same camp last year so we knew most of the kids...if any of you have worked at camps you know that already knowing the kids helps because then you can skip past the "getting to know who they are" stage and get right to the good stuff with them and that's what i got to do with some of the guys there...it also is kool because sometimes at camps kids are viewed as "projects" or some "code to crack", this time it was very different because i count most of those kids my friends and i genuinely do want to help them and see God do awesome things in their lives...

i also got to actually lead worship last week which took up quite a bit of my time during the day...but ended up being very rewarding...i had to empty myself daily and let God fill me...getting up in front of people is a big deal and i wanted whatever was said to be straight from God and nothing that i conjured up...that alone was pretty scary...but God did some amazing things in me through it and i learned alot...i realized that in order to be God's mouthpiece you gotta shutup and let Him talk...

this week i'm back to the drab...my dull life back at work..."normal" life...i am challenging myself, however, to live extraordinarily and never settle for the mediocre, the same ol' thing, or the "normal" life...i know now more than ever that God has so much in store for me if i would just get off my butt and realize it a little more often...i'm learning to dream...to think outside the box that we've been put in by the world..."we were meant to live for so much more" and it's time that i start living like it...

...on that note i must get back to work for only 15 more minutes...at which time i will be free from the chains that bind me to this chair and computer screen to roam around sugarcreek in search of a tasty meal...mmmmm...

until next time faithful xangacians...
