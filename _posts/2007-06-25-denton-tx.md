i'm sitting in our hotel room here in oklahoma city and i'm going to attempt to write about three shows ago in denton but the details may be a little fuzzy...it's been a combination of late nights, long drives and alot of hanging out with our texas friends that have prevented me from getting on to post about the tour...my apologies...i also have alot of pictures to upload but the connection here in this fine days inn is a little spotty...suprising, i know...i'll try to get them up next time...<br /><br />we played at a pretty cool club/bar in denton called "hailey's"...we didn't get the greatest turnout to the show in the world...but what we didn't get in quantity we made up for in quality...the show was set up by our good friend dustin, who also set up our show in abilene...he also helps head up the production company that is putting out the "murkville" compilation we are going to be apart of with alot of other great bands...which by the way is slated to come out oct. 27th...<br /><br />so for this show state bird actually "headlined" i guess...which is just a big way of saying that we played last...which really doesn't mean much on a tour like this but it still was kind of cool to get "top billing"...i'm throwing out all the industry words here...i'm so hip and with it...anyways, winston jazz played first, then discover america and then us...the guy who opened up the show was very good as well...his name was jeremy and was kind enough to let most of us stay over at his place in denton...<br /><br />the big story from this show was what happened afterwards, though...apparently there was a big shindig going on at someone's house nearby and all of us bands were invited...so we headed over there along with dustin and as we got close we could tell it was going to be a pretty crazy party...probably not one we needed to be at...and that was confirmed as we were driving by said house looking for a parking space and heard a guy shouting "hey someone call an ambulance...this guy got stabbed!"...we couldn't tell if it was a joke but we just kept on driving anyways and it was a good thing we did...the cops weren't far behind and dustin's car got pinned in as he got there a few minutes before us...turns out it wasn't a joke and it was a pretty big deal...some of the other guys in the band actually saw the bloody kid slumped over and trying to get help...pretty crazy and unfortunately for the fine people we met in denton, it's probably going to scar our memories of the place...we're just lucky we didn't get there sooner...<br /><br />so that was denton...good times and crazy stories...
