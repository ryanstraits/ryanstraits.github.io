<em>"when you're tired and alone and you feel like letting go..."</em>

so school was just the thing to do it...

just the thing to utterly asphyxiate whatever remaining time (or computer time i should say) i have that could be spent typing up these lovely entries...yea well...rarely do i spend an evening at home anymore...let alone vertical in front of a computer screen...at this point, i'm pretty sure the weekends will be my only respite from life...and oh, what a welcome respite they are...

some of you just learned a new word...go look it up...

in other news: band things have been going well...we "live" recorded a few tunes on friday night...nothing worthy of entering anyone else's ears except our own but we currently have three solid songs and a few other ideas brewing...i'm not sure if that means anything to anyone at this point...but it's a fair accomplishment in my eyes...

things with the six:forty band have been quite hectic as of late (but when has it not been?)...we're currently working through our 432,059th personnel change in the past 18 months since i took over leading...but there's a glimmer of hope in view...mostly because i'm really excited about this new batch of folks coming in and the possibilities of where we can go from here...but getting there...well that's another story...and having patience through it all? that's not even in the same book...

anything else not mentioned in the former paragraph...well obviously...i don't have time for it either...

speak of the devil...look at the time...it's off to school for this kid...

<em>"come home..."</em>
