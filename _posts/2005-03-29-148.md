<em>sing with your head up...with your eyes closed...not because you love the song...</em>

funny how a week away can suddenly make the mundane seem novel again...

well...at least for a day that is...i'm well into the daily grind by now, however...and the novelty has quickly wore off...it was a crazy weekend and so far this week's starting off to be much of the same...

overall, last week was very relaxing...we only had two days of real sunshine, though...but it was in the high 60's-low 70's for most of the week...so i'm not complaining...everyday felt like a saturday...and that's a successful vacation in my book...i did alot of reading...and a whole lot of nothing...it was good to spend time w/ the fam...good to run on the beach...and most of all, it felt good to be warmed by the sun...which of course whetted my appetite even more for the coming summer...thank goodness the clouds are breaking here in ohio and we're getting some decent weather over the next few days...or so they're saying...i've learned not to trust those sneaky weather folks lately...

so then by friday everyone but me was aching to get back home...but our van wasn't having any of it...the big ol' guy just wanted to stay in hilton head apparently cuz he broke down the night before we left...so we nearly got marooned on the island for the entire easter weekend...but luckily my dad found a minivan to rent and we all crammed in and made the 10 hour trip back home...not so bad after all...although i wouldn't have minded stickin' around for a few more days that's fer darn sure...

but it didn't let up there...oh no...not by a mile...i was once again confined to the small spaces of a car for the entire day sunday...as we dotted the countryside visiting nearly every living relative on both sides of the family...gotta love those holy-days...

six:forty tonite...i'm looking forward to it most anticipatingly...

i'll be back with more soon...and very soon...
