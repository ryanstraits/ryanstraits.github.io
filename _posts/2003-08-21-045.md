<em>"Quantum theory says that nature is discrete, so the visible universe we inhabit is characterized by a finite amount of information; if space is infinite, this informational pattern is bound to repeat at vast enough distances. A back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that there should be an exact copy of you around 10 to the 10 to the 28<sup>th</sup> light-years away..."</em>

...man, if i could just find my other self...wouldn't that be sweet...i bet we'd have so many stories to share...i'd like to see what life would be like in his shoes...maybe he's got a girlfriend we could share...hmmmm...

so xanga and i have been on the outs lately...i was under the condition that we had a good thing going here...but apparently all that xanga wants is an unstable, unreliable, untrustworthy and ultimately unhealthy relationship...so we're just gonna hafta see about that...

this week we lost a billy...<a href="http://www.xanga.com/unsubscribe" target="_blank">this lil' billy</a> moved to cincinnati this week...things will never be the same: tues. nights watching am. idol and smallville...all night phase 10 games w/ the billy club...vdo runs...worship time at six:forty...and so much more...bill, the past few years have been a blast...i know God's gonna do some cool stuff in and through your life down there in cincy...but make sure you don't ever forget your best billy bud's up here in new billadelphia...

tonite i am going down the the dreaded branch to buy my books for classes...i can't believe they start next week already...i sware the summer is the shortest of the seasons...maybe because it's the best...however, i do love fall...but hate that it means winter is only 3 months away...anyways, after that i am either goin to canton w/ some friends or lay down some tracks for aaron and i's recording project...we're doing our own version of relient k's "getting into you"...it's turning out good so far...

to all my wonderful xangarian readers...you're the best...
