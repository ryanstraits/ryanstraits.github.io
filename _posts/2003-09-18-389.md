<em>"i'm dizzy from the shopping mall...i searched for joy but i bought it all...it doesn't help the hunger pain...and a thirst i'd have to drown first to ever satiate..."</em>

the world is searching...for something they know not of...i have been entrusted with answers...and called to show them love...but alas, i have a life...no time for this...go to my job...live for God on the side...i try to find purpose of my own...when it's been spelled out all along...who in this world am i trying to kid?...am i to live out my life like this?...God forbid...

i meant to post an entry earlier in the week but after sitting at a blank entry page for more than an hour each time, i eventually gave up...somehow i lost my inspiration...i know i wasn't being inspired by that ghastly picture of me on a motorcyle...so i changed it to a pic i happened upon today...a picture more reminiscient of my former life...

this past weekend, one of the best movies of all time was on tv and i taped it..."the usual suspects" appeared profanity free to national television and even though it is amazing, i just had to laugh at all the overdubbing they had to do to make it tv worthy...words like "fairy godmother", "blood sucker" and a whole lot of "friggin's" were added to the movie instead of the several hundred uses of the f-bomb...now it's family safe...yippee...i celebrated by making a bunch of my friends watch it sat. nite...the few that stuck around and didn't fall asleep agreed along w/ me and countless others that it is a timeless classic worthy of much praise and adoration...and that stephen baldwin has actually made a movie worth watching...unbelievable...

friday, i happened upon another great movie currently in theaters...instead of spending another friday nite all by myself (my 2nd in a row), at around 9:30pm out of sheer disgust for the bleakness of my existence i called up my good friend chris and implored him to go watch a movie with me to salvage what was left of a very bland day...we caught "matchstick men" w/ nicholas cage and sam rockwell and were both pleasantly surprised...besides being a clever con-artist caper it's capped off at the end by a very unsuspecting twist (and those of you that know me know i love movie's w/ twists)...we both walked away changed men...ok maybe not, but i am beginning to change my view of one mr. nicholas cage...i once thought of him as that guy who's prone to star in cheesy action flicks ("con-air", "the rock", "snake eyes", "gone in 60 seconds", etc.)...but somehow he's broken that mold and is starting to play edgier roles...in "matchstick men" he plays a man w/ obsessive/compulsive disorder and does a killer job at looking stupid, in "adaptation" (a great flick for those of you who haven't seen it, it's only downfall being the casting of meryl streep...yikes) he plays charlie kaufman, a screenwriter w/ a less than exciting life, and once again nick does a great job of playing a dork...see nick, for some reason you thought you were an action hero and now you're slowly starting to realize the roles you were meant to play...the dorky roles, the ones that make you look like a complete idiot but at the same time absolutely brilliant...those are the ones that we like you in, nick...so stick with it and keep up the good work buddy...

adios xang-amigos...
