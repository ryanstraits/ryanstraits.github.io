yea so here's a good one...especially coming out of my mouth (or from the tips of my fingers i should say...or type)...

i'm actually looking forward to the fall...

<!-- break -->

yipes...that just didn't sound right...but it's true...this summer has been chalked fullÂ with disappointment and general unexcitement...there have been several gleams of shiny goodness that have peaked their heads through the clouds here and there...but they were definitely few and far between...so it grieves me to say that i'm glad that summer is almost over...

i say almost because i currently have a uncompleted 10 page co-op paper sitting in front of me...due at the end of this week...and when am i starting on it?...tonight would be the correct answer...i'm actually looking forward to going back to school this fall...to be in a normal class...in a classroom...with a live instructor talking to you...online classes are just dreadful...especially over the summer...the fact i'm looking forward to "normal" class should tip you off to that much...

oh and for those who wanted to know...coldplay was great...but there was something amiss...
