i need to finish a song...that would feel really good for me right about now...i have like three or four near completion...that's the way it always goes for me though...i got this thing where i can't officially complete anything of worth...it's a subconsious tick of mine i guess...cuz maybe if i don't finish it then when people say they don't like it i can just mark it up to incompletion...

dang my subconscious is clever...wish he'd think for me all the time...

"well i don't think we're that late...we needn't go that fast...but maybe i should stop for those things...looks like they're coming down over the railroad tracks roughly 50 feet in front of us"...
<span style="color:#cccccc;">"well i've never seen that before...i wonder what it means"...</span>
"by golly geez there's a train coming...maybe i should stop what do you think gladys?"...

<em>*both of today's entries are based on actual events witnessed on my way to school one day last week...yes i nearly saw an old couple get flattened by an oncoming train...apparently they didn't see the flashing lights or those big long rails coming down right in front of them...they stopped in time but were literally only feet from getting hit...and they say there shouldn't be a maximum driving age? uhhh yeeeaa...</em>
