so we're at war...or kind of at war...it's been pretty anti-climatic so far...all the news stations are really trying to stretch it out until the actual "war" happens...and it's pretty funny to watch and see them reporting about meaningless little events hoping that the United States will start blowing things up soon so they can actually report on things that really matter...

<!-- break -->

as far as the war issue is concerned, i guess i'm pretty indifferent on the whole thing (consider this a very rare politically themed post by me, believe me it won't happen very often, but maybe it will actually spur some people to comment on my posts, yippee)...i have become quite disturbed/annoyed by this whole war experience lately...and not just by the little "skirmishes" or the reporting of those "skirmishes" in the middle east...but also by the attitudes of us here at home...

i'm mostly annoyed by the fact that everyone is so quick to jump on the anti-war bandwagon lately...now it's the cool thing to do..."all the chic movie stars/recording artists/eccentrics are doing it so it must be the right thing to do" or "even if it isn't i'll look cool if i agree with them" seems like the attitude alot of people are taking these days...i was talking to my good friend seth herman about it a few nights ago and he brought up a very interesting point...he said that "it's like people are trying to make this into the 60's all over again and it's just not happening"...it's like all the adamant pro-war and anti-war people are back here safe behind the walls of "fortress america" debating it out, picketing, holding rallies and whatnot while the real indifferents are the people who are actually fighting the war and may ultimately lose their lives...

another thing that somewhat disturbs me about all this anti-war protesting are all the people who are convinced that it is God's will that we shouldn't be at war...how are you so sure? God used war all throughout the Bible...God wiped out entire nations...while i know that was a whole different period of time in history and that God worked in different ways back then i'm not totally convinced that God doesn't use war today to accomplish his will...so instead of praying for peace, shouldn't we be praying for God's will to be done and that he would be glorified no matter what happens?...i could go alot more in depth into this and try to explain why there are conflicts over there now and whatnot...but that would take too much time and i don't know if i even understand it all...

which is partially why i am remaining indifferent on the whole thing...i don't know all that's going on and so why give myself to a certain cause when i don't know all the facts?...i'm just going to worry about myself and let God worry about all that...so i ask all you people who are getting yourselves caught up in this whole war debacle: do you even know what we're fighting for over there? do you think that by giving yourself to any cause, whether anti-war or pro-war, that you're really gonna solve anything or change the direction that our nation is already heading?

so while this whole overall war experience has been annoying and somewhat disturbing so far...it has given me one more good reason to hate the dixie chicks...and for that i am truly grateful...
