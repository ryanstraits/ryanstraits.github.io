<em>"love is watching someone die..."</em>

ok so it's been a while...

<!-- break -->

it's kinda been an awkward time for me and xanga lately...i'm not sure what terms we're on...so i've just been taking a break...thinking things through yah know...really sorting things out...

actually i've just been busy...and well...lazy too...all at the same time...imagine that...

so now...instead of complaining about how boring yet frenzily busy my life is now that school has started back up...i thought i'd share a bit on what forms of media i've been engaged with lately...take a gander:

<strong>books
</strong>1. <span style="color:#afbfcf;"><em>mere christianity</em> <em>(cs lewis)</em>:</span> very insightful...lack of time is probably the only feasible excuse i can come up with as to why i haven't read this sooner...i've been gleaning alot from it though and hope to possibly share some with you all shortly...
2. <span style="color:#afbfcf;"><em>blue like jazz</em> <em>(donald miller)</em>:</span> haven't actually started reading this one yet...but it's looking like it will fit along quite nicely with lewis' timeless work..."non-religious thoughts on christian spirituality" is the subtitle...i think we could all use a nice dose of that from time to time...

<strong>video
</strong>1. <span style="color:#afbfcf;"><em>the life aquatic</em>:</span> just received the criterion collection of this dvd in the mail yesterday from half.com...and for a rock bottom price of course...you've got to love all the little extras included on these collector's discs...hopefully the movie warms up to me as much as the extras surely will...
2. <span style="color:#afbfcf;"><em>dumb and dumber</em>:</span> it's a classic...quotes from this movie have worked their way into my everyday vernacular...it's a must have...and now i have it...and of course i purchased it for dirt cheap from half.com...where else?
3. <em><span style="color:#afbfcf;">madden nfl 2006</span></em><span style="color:#afbfcf;">:</span> let's just say i devote roughly an hour a day to this unusually addictive game (ususual because i was never a big football fan until i started playing it...curse you john madden) as i attempt to get the indianapolis colts to the super bowl...they're obviously going to need <em>my</em> help to do so...

<strong>music
</strong>1. <span style="color:#afbfcf;"><em>death cab for cutie (plans)</em>:</span> it's their major label debut...so many will undoubtedly scoff "they've sold out"...i personally think it's grand...and have been reveling in it's brilliance...
2. <span style="color:#afbfcf;"><em>jack's mannequin (everything in transit)</em>:</span> it's the solo project of the lead singer of something corporate...so it's basically much in the same vein as said band yet with more heart...at any rate it's pure piano pop-rock...and good for a listen or two hundred...
3. <span style="color:#afbfcf;"><em>our lady peace (healty in paranoid times)</em>:</span> they're starting to drift back to the mold-breaking roots that caught the ear of this particular listener roughly a decade ago from their more recent radio-friendly release "gravity"...and that i applaud...however...i think their spark is fading...they've peaked and are on the downslide...most unfortunate...sometimes it's good to just go out on top...
4. <span style="color:#afbfcf;"><em>switchfoot (nothing is sound)</em>:</span> i'm the kinda fan that if you made good music and make that good music at impressionable times in my life...i won't abandon you when you blow up and make your major label debut...and are on the radio <em>all</em> the time...that is unless you start to suck...
