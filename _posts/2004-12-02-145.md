<em>over the summer, through the fall and into winter we go...</em>

<!-- break -->

we've officially hit the 20's here in ol' ohio...but surprisingly i'm not very bothered by it...yes i know...you're probably all in shock...i've actually been pretty indifferent to the cold...i've mostly been hating the dreariness of our weather lately...yesterday was the first time the sun poked through in well over a week...give me the sun and i can make it til april...well maybe only til january...ah yes...january...the month when you're ready for winter to be over and really it's only just begun...dang...now i've talked myself into hating winter again...good job ryan...

well i haven't posted in a good while...i apologize to all you avid xanga-goers out there...to be honest there hasn't been much striking my creative chords lately that really is worthy of posting...i've actually been in a creative slump...this could be because of my latest excursion into video gaming...yes...shameful i know...though john madden is a supremely annoying man he does offer quite a fine football gaming experience...and an incredibly addicting one at that...

but on the more productive side of things...i've been on an ebay selling kick lately as well...as you may know i've been on quite a few ebay buying kicks in the past...well those days are done...i'm turning the tables on that blasted ebay...it's sucked too much money outta me and now i'm gonna milk it for all it's worth...and i'm doing just swimmingly at it so far...i put a few cd's up on half.com and have sold 4 already...and for those of you who may enjoy the new christian band "sanctus real"...boy do i have a treat for you...i currently have their independent album up for bid on ebay right now...if you're interested go <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;rd=1&amp;item=4056175229&amp;ssPageName=STRK:MESE:IT" target="_blank">here</a> and bid now...but prepare to spend a pretty penny on it...as there are apparently many huge sanctus real fans out there in dire need of this cd...and apparently they're all crazy...the band isn't even that good...

lastly, to add a wee bit of creativity to this pretty bland post i'll include a link to my <a href="http://www.the-review.com/archive/11222004/PDF/C06.pdf" target="_blank">national treasure review</a> that was printed a few weeks back...i didn't review a movie last weekend as "alexander" didn't seem like it was going to provide much in the way of anything remotely interesting to write on (except that it flopped horribly at the box office)...so my reviewing schedule is going to shape up like this for the coming weeks (all movies i am very greatly anticpating):
<ul>
	<li>dec. 3 - finding neverland</li>
	<li>dec. 10 - ocean's twelve</li>
	<li>dec. 17 - the aviator</li>
	<li>dec. 25 - the life aquatic</li>
</ul>
more (possibly deeper ponderings) soon and very soon...
