so i had an interesting weekend of sorts...

<!-- break -->

that is if interesting includes doing absolutely nothing with anyone besides myself both friday and saturday nite...sunday nite i was planning on going to see lovedrug in akron with <a href="http://www.xanga.com/averagejoe" target="_blank">joe</a>...but apparently mother nature is not a big fan of amazing concerts and she wouldn't let us go even with our tickets in hand...i ended up going down to my friend sheena's house and had a pretty good time despite the horrible storm in the out-of-doors...

i now remember the only thing i liked about high school...snow days...my sis has had the past three school days off and they even cancelled classes at the branch today...of course it's the day i don't have classes there so no freebie days for me...nooo...not for this working man...i still have to wake up and ford through the snow and be the faithful little employee that i am and be here at my desk by 8am...no one has any regard for my personal well-being and safety as they do for the local school kids...nope...engineering technicians are easily replaceable apparently...like school kids aren't...i mean c'mon...oh well...i am getting paid as i sit here and type this entry...so take that pesky teachers and school kids...

six:forty was cancelled tonite and i am pretty bummed about it...we were going to be debuting a new song that i am quite fond of...speaking of six:forty, be expecting an official six:forty website coming in the next few months...i met w/ cam this past weekend and we started brainstorming on the site of which i hope to get started on here in the next few weeks...

well that's about it for me today...i sincerely apologize for this snooze of an entry...maybe i'd have more time to think about witty and creative entries if i'd have a few snow days here and there where i could just around and think about xanga all day...geesh...4-8 inches of snow possible tonite...how can i possibly be asked to work in these conditions?

how about i cancel my life on account of inclement weather...
