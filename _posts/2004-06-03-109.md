ok so just to clarify about my previous post...those movie reviews weren't entirely serious...alot of it was for comedic effect as most of you probably picked up on...apparently though, some of you did not get it (i don't really think garfield is going to be a good movie...notice i only commented on the fact that jennifer love hewitt is in it...us guys tend to think she's good-looking...)...so i decided to jot down my REAL list of movies that i think look good or that i'm looking forward to this summer and the reasons why i like them...so for all you movie buffs, quasi-critics, and cynics of my brand of humor...dig in:

<!-- break -->

<strong>ryan's REAL top 10 most anticipated movies of the summer</strong>
<ol>
	<li><strong>anchorman </strong>-<em> pros:</em> will ferrell is in it (need i say more?), steven carell is also in it (he was hilarious in bruce almighty), it takes place in the 70's and in san diego  <em>cons:</em> absolutely none...</li>
	<li><strong>the village</strong> -<em> pros:</em> m. night shyamalan (director/writer), probably the only good mystery/suspense/thriller of the summer, shyamalan is the master of 11th hour twists  <em>cons:</em> the ending is supposed to suck...but they say that about all his movies...</li>
	<li><strong>the terminal</strong> - <em>pros:</em> it looks quirky and interesting, i think spielberg and hanks make a great combination...they proved that with "catch me if you can"  <em>cons:</em> it could try to be too quirky and end up annoying and bland...but i really don't think spielberg or hanks would let it come to that...at least i'm hoping so...</li>
	<li><strong>spider-man 2</strong> - <em>pros:</em> big budget action, superhero mythology (which i have to stay current on so i'm primed for the inevitable sequels)  <em>cons:</em> too much hype/oversaturation, i'm not a spider-man fanatic (as far as superheroes go, i'm much more excited for the new batman movie next summer and the supposed superman movie in the works)...</li>
	<li><strong>the bourne supremacy</strong> -<em> pros:</em> the first one was pretty good, i haven't seen a good spy/action/suspense flick in a good while <em>cons: </em>it's definitely not mission impossible and matt damon is no tom cruise</li>
	<li><strong>king arthur</strong> - <em>pros:</em> clive owen (he was killer in those short bmw flicks that were on the net a while back) and keira knightley (latest british acting sensation) are both in it, it's supposed to stick closer to the "real" arthur story (i didn't know there was a real story to begin with?)  <em>cons:</em> i just don't know what to expect from this one, the promo's haven't really shown me much to go on...</li>
	<li><strong>the manchurian candidate</strong> - <em>pros:</em> oooh...i just read the premise of this movie and it actually sounds pretty darn good, plus it's got denzel...it's gotta be good right?  <em>cons:</em> it releases the same day as "the village", the plot seems a little far-fetched...i'm wondering if they can really pull it off, it's based on an old sinatra movie...so who knows what this will turn out like...</li>
	<li><strong>collateral</strong> -<em> pros:</em> tom cruise as a bad guy, michael mann is directing, frank darabont (the green mile, shawshank redemption, etc.) did a rewrite on the scipt, this movie has definite potential  <em>cons:</em> jamie foxx</li>
	<li><strong>harry potter 3</strong> - <em>pros:</em> i don't know...i've just had this sudden urge to get into harry potter lately...i'm not even sure why...however, i do need to see the 2nd movie first  <em>cons:</em> all the hype and annoying people that get way too into all this stuff (not you joe)...</li>
	<li><strong>around the world in 80 days</strong> - <em>pros:</em> i honestly don't know what appeals to me about this movie besides the fact that the wilson brothers have a cameo in it as the wright brothers (maybe the fact that this even made my list is a sign that this is gonna be a dismal summer at the movies...)  <em>cons:</em> from the previews doesn't this movie feel like "wild, wild west" only with jackie chan instead of will smith?</li>
</ol>
ok, enough with all this movie business...it's making me think way too much about them when the whole goal of movies is to disconnect yourself from your world for a few hours and escape into another one...so now, to please all you music-lovers out there...here's a fun little list for you:

<strong>disc's currently rotating in the in-dash six:</strong>
<ol>
	<li>brandtson - send us a signal</li>
	<li>new found glory - catalyst</li>
	<li>underoath - they're only chasing safety</li>
	<li>starfield - starfield</li>
	<li>cool hand luke - the fires of life</li>
	<li>various worship tunes mix</li>
</ol>
so that was a boring list-filled entry...i sorely apologize...and hope to type up a non-movie-related post tomorrow if i get time (i'm a busy man you know)...so hold onto your hats folks...
