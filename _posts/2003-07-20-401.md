one down and one to go...the summer could end now and i would be one happy camper (ha!)...however, i'm sure glad the summer is only half over...hopefully the next half will hold as much goodness as the first half has...

last week was a blast...i once again had the amazing privilege of leading worship at a youth camp...i am continually humbled that God would use me in this way...this time around we ventured to the far-reaching expanses of rural kansas (aka nowhere)...the heat index averaged from 105-110 degrees (aka hot)...and the drive was around 12-14 hrs. one way (aka long)...but it was worth it all to hear roughly 400 kids praising God at the top of their lungs...i'll miss all the new friends made...the old friends reacquainted...and all my crazy little jr. high bunkmates...i pray that all the decisions to follow christ and to "live the difference" will last into eternity when i will no doubt see you all again (but hopefully sometime before then)...

this was one of the last trips for the original, late, great "team" as this coming year will undoubtedly bring many changes to our lineup...however, this trip gave us one final chance to minister together and play our hearts out for the glory of God...something i will always remember...the all-through-the-night driving got pretty rough, but all-in-all the road trip to and from KC was filled with many enjoyable moments including: taking digitalized pictures of unsuspecting bandmates and using them as blackmail, growing out our facial hair (oh wait that was just me...i'll be posting pics of it later this week), listening to an entire cd of "real men of genius" commercials, making up our own slew of laffy-taffy type jokes and various other forms of tomfoolery (which i'm not quite sure what that word means but it sounds funny and would make a great band name)...

peace out xanga-ites...and if you went to camp last week and found me on here leave me a comment and i'll add you to my list...

"i'm gonna l the d....p the p...cuz it's a or n...n c..."
