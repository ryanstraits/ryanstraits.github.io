It's been nearly 2 months since I moved to Kansas City. Much has happened. I hope to bring you a full-featured update in the shape of a long-form post within the next few days.

Until then, here is a glimpse of a few of the things I've been working on while I'm still unemployed:

+ <a href="http://www.yeameneither.com/" target="_blank">yeameneither.com</a> - A fun, little website based on a Twitter trend (#yeameneither) that my friend <a href="http://travisgeary.com/" target="_blank">Travis</a> and I started for the heck of it.

+ <a href="http://twitter.Com/dctalkraps" target="_blank">DCTalk Raps</a> - What, you haven't heard of DC Talk Raps yet? Oh, you will. A DC Talk rap in your Twitter feed everyday? Are you kidding me? Life just doesn't get better than that.

+ <a href="http://godateventide.Tumblr.Com/" target="_blank">God At Eventide</a> - I bought this old devotional book from 1965 from a thrift store here in KC after the note scribbled on the first page intrigued me: "To my sweetheart of 30 years who is making my life one of thrills and joys together as we walk upward toward our eternal home. - Your Sweetheart". I decided to start posting each day's devotion as I read them.

Oh yes. And I've also found myself a lady friend. The coolest girl I know on either side of the Mississippi. So far, KC, you've done well.

More to come soon, friends!
