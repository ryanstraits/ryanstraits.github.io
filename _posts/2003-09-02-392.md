square one, my good friend...

i'm back again...

although i have been gone for quite some time, i have retreated back to the only place i truly know...a place i know all too well...however, i am finally beginning to find contentment here...maybe i don't even want to leave anymore...maybe i want to stay here...maybe i'm better off without you...

for the time being at least...

what an interesting weekend i've had...it all started w/ a bang fri. nite when i got picked up for speeding after i voluteered to drive my friend sheena home...this is my 2nd speeding violation this year and it's not good for my new insurance w/ my brand new car...yikes...sat. i accompanied my bud troy to michigan to pick up his new car and we then ventured to the city of jackson to visit some kids that were at this last camp we did in the beginning of august...it was great to see them if only for an hour and a half...sat. also brought the arrival of my friend scott from lewisburg who came up and stayed w/ me for the weekend...we hoped for a more exciting labor(less) day but instead got to witness new phila being turned into a city such as venice, italy where they have no streets, only waterways...which was nice for all the people who didnt' take their boat out to the lake and could just float around town if need be...

jt is sick and i am leading worship at six:forty tonite...this is scary because i barely have had a chance to think about this let alone plan what we're going to do...

yippee...
