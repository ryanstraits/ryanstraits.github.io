alas alas...xanga ol' friend...how i have missed you so...two weeks have near gone by and yet i have paid you no mind...wretched am i...

so tonite i leave for kansas city to take part in the first of two youth camps i will be leadingÂ worship at this summer...it's been almost a year since the last camp i went too so i am anxiously anticipating this one...one final roadtrip w/ "the team", seeing old friends in KC and 400 kids praising God at the top of their lungs...nothing could be sweeter...

last nite i ventured out into unexplored territory and bought my first brand new car...i'm pretty excited about it...it's a 2003 mazda protege 5...seems like so much has changed for me in the past 2 months...i finished school...got a new, steady job...got a new car...heck i even rearranged my room around...crazy how we humans can change so much, so fast...it's comforting to know that my God will never change...he's the same yesterday, today and tomorrow...

...words to live by brought to you by ryan m. straits...

have a good week everyone...
