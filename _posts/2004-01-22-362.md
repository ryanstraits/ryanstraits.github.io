autocad is the devil incarnate...everyone these days is wondering who the antichrist is going to be...well i'm pretty sure i've got it figured out...he has manifested himself as the humble drafting program named autocad 2004...at work today i was just doing a few simple updates when all kinds of junk started appearing on my drawings and after messing with it all afternoon i now realize that i am going to have to redo a whole bunch of my assembly drawings...it's going to be a massive undertaking...and i'm definitely not happy about it...ok so maybe autocad 2004 isn't the antichrist...but i am pretty sure he's going to be involved with computers in some form or another...right <a href="http://www.xanga.com/abertroyle" target="_new">troy</a>?

so as i begin into my new spring work and school routine, i've also fallen into an inevitable regular tv watching schedule...which this spring will most likely consist of smallville, the oc and american idol...as most of you know smallville has topped my list of favorite shows over the past few years...but it just may be bettered by the oc as of late...as much as i hate to say it my interest in smallville is waning...maybe it's the lack of intriguing plot lines lately...maybe it's the fact that it's finally sunk in that lana and clark will never get together and i wish they'd just quit toying with our emotions...or maybe it's cuz i don't have anyone sharing in my fanatical watching and theorizing as i did last season with my good pal <a href="http://www.xanga.com/unsubscribe" target="_new">billy</a>...these are sad days my friends...i wish it were not so...smallville is now no. 2 on my list of current favorite shows...perish the thought...alas, i must move on...on the bright side, though, i now have gained the oc as my new favorite show...a truly great program with very interesting, dynamic characters (and it's set in cali-forn-i-a baby)...however, not one girl on the oc will ever replace my love for lana (so don't worry bill)...that is one thing that will never change...ok...i'll stop now...i'm really not obsessed...really...i promise....

tonite i venture to canton to vist <a href="http://www.xanga.com/averagejoe" target="_new">joe</a> as he endeavors to find himself in the vast and incredibly bleak realm known to many as "college"...oh no wait...i was thinking about the branch there for a second...joe actually went away to college...but it is malone college...so i guess it's not incredibly bleak...just bleak...

in other news: i'm going to see <a href="http://www.lovedrugmusic.com" target="_new">lovedrug</a> on sunday nite and i'm greatly excited about it...

i'm hip to the scene once again...
