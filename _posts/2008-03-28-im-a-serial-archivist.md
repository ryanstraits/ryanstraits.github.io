<p>there, i've admitted it.<br /><br />basically, i'm all but addicted to the act of archiving. maybe i should have become a librarian or some form of historian tasked with the strict keeping of records and the timely submission of important data into the ol' trusty vault.</p>
<p>really, all i did was buy myself a brand new external hard drive for the filing and/or archiving of all my most valuable digital things (i.e. music, photos, etc.), but i think the fact that i'm so excited about it is what's most disturbing (at least to most normal human beings outside of my head).</p>
<p>so as we speak i'm backing up my ipod. sure, laugh now but when all you kiddies' ipods inevitably explode, you'll be wishing you had archived too.</p>
<p>maybe pathological is a better adjective.&nbsp;</p>
