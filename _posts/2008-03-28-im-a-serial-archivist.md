There, I've admitted it.

<!-- break -->

Basically, I'm all but addicted to the act of archiving. Maybe I should have become a librarian or some form of historian tasked with the strict keeping of records and the timely submission of important data into the ol' trusty vault.

Really, all I did was buy myself a brand new external hard drive for the filing and/or archiving of all my most valuable digital things (i.e. music, photos, etc.), but I think the fact that I'm so excited about it is what's most disturbing (at least to most normal human beings outside of my head).

So as we speak I'm backing up my iPod. Sure, laugh now but when all you kiddies' iPods inevitably explode, you'll be wishing you had archived too.

Maybe pathological is a better adjective.
