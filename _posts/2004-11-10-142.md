<em>i go forward...and you go backwards....</em>

<!-- break -->

sorry for the lacking of updates lately...it's been one string of madness after the next around here...so moments of clarity that need to occur to write xanga entries have been few and far between...besides that i've been spending a good 'bit of my creative energy writing movie reviews on the weekend...it's been fun but taxing as well...i'll try to post a link to my latest review (this week: i heart huckabees...next: the incredibles?) as soon as it goes live...

hope you all are well...i've been trying to comment more on your sites to make up for my lower post count so i hope that makes up some...and don't kill me for my ranting below...but i've been pushed past my limit with the media...take what is said with that in mind...and i hope to give ya'll a positive entry to chew on by the week's end...

until then...

<em>uhoh...it's time for...</em>
<strong>ryan's post-election wrap-up</strong>

i can feel the shudders and hisses even now...but don't worry...there won't be any cheering or jeering here because of the election results...the media has done plenty for both the red and blue states (of mind) combined...my beef here is with another group in our fine nation...the rock gods and movie stars...

they're now saying that all the celebrities stumping for kerry actually hurt his campaign...i'm sorry but that's pretty darn funny right there...cuz they obviously thought they were helping...and hopefully they'll get it through their (rather thick) heads now that we don't care what their political persuasions are...poor ol' kerry's probly wishing someone would have told him that before he let them invade all his campaign stops...but thank goodness it's true...the fact that we're not trusting something as vital as the office of the president of our great nation to the hollywood elite (not saying kerry was a horrible candidate...but i won't get into that here like i promised)...

i mean really...would you trust a guy like "the boss", or michael moore, or ben affleck, or leonardo dicrapio (i misspelled that intentionally...shameless i know) or any of the others in the so-called "upper crust" of our televised society with the care of this nation? how is this not just another self-aggrandizing, attention-getting scheme like all the rest? i mean...i enjoy most of these guy's movies (that would be directed to brad pitt, sean penn, and the like...not particularly affleck and dicaprio or moore for that matter...) and some of their music (except when it's glaringly political-focused...)...but i just get so sick of them preaching to us about the way things should be and how horrible our country is...they've obviously made a good life for themselves here...they're not living in deplorable conditions, etc...so why are they always the ones opening their big mouths? now, i understand that some would label it as "using your platform to share your beliefs" or whatever...and i guess in some way there is a place for that...but we pay them to set trends and make music and movies...not to teach us politics or the state of the nation...

so c'mon...give us all a break, hollywood...we don't need you and we never have...you represent roughly 0.1% of this country...and now you realize that...all your grandstanding got you nowhere this november...in fact if you would have kept your mouth shut and worked harder at getting some better movies out this year (it's been pretty dismal at the theaters) we'd all be alot happier...and i'd even venture a guess that kerry would have had a better chance without you...i guess you thought you were going to influence the "youth vote"...yeah what happened to them?...where'd all those "vote or die" t-shirts go all the sudden papa diddy puff? well they obviously didn't vote...so what other option does that leave you with? that's a lil extreme i know...so i propose a new shirt..."vote or we'll go away"...now that's something the youth of this country could get into...

so here's the lesson from today's rant: when this generation of hollywood hotshots are gone...there will be a thriving, young group poised to take all your spots...and i sure hope they take a few notes from you washed up old fogies...yes i'm talking to you, <a href="http://au.news.yahoo.com/041109/19/rnmi.html" target="_blank">madonna</a> and you too <a href="http://barbrastreisand.com/statements.html#wemusthavepatience" target="_blank">barbra streisand</a>...no one outside of your little fan clubs care what you think...we never have...and in this election america has proved it...the trendy, uber-chic center of hollywood exits to entertain...not to motivate...of course i don't mean all films or music in that generalization...cuz there have been many that have motivated me to a change...but they definitely aren't ones made by michael moore...or ones with ben affleck and leo in them...and i know for sure the boss or "american idiots" like green day haven't done any of their soundtracks...no those are left for the truly creative people out there...

anyways...i'm glad their are truly great comedians out there like <a href="http://www.philhendrieshow.com" target="_blank">phil hendrie</a> who take material like this and run with it...everyone else is too scared they'll get their wrists slapped evidently...this is some truly hilarious stuff...someone needs to capitalize on it...and i'm sure glad phil has...he keeps me in stitches all day at work...i'll be getting his latest cd "fahrenheit 7/11" soon...so if you're interested i'll burn you copies...you won't regret it...

finally, if you're looking for a great, objectively-written wrap-up of the election with somewhat of a christian slant do check this article out <a href="http://www.relevantmagazine.com/article.php?sid=5116" target="_blank">here</a>...it may be a little less biased than i have been...

<em>and somewhere we will meet...</em>
