<!-- break -->

let me first tell you that yes...it can be...and you too can post short entries as well...i along with many others have struggled with what has come to be referred to as "long-post syndrome"...it's a horrifying and ultimately chronic disorder...but it can be suppressed and treated if counteracted quickly enough...please don't hesitate to contact your local physician or internet service provider for further information on how you too can curb this shameful malady...

don't wait...call today...

yea...ok...so i waste my one short entry of the year on something stupid like that...sorry...it's the first thing that came outta my mouth...err...my fingers...probably as a result of a long, tedious and ulimately brain-frying day...so take it as it is folks...and now to round out my short entry...a short and random list of things i am currently anticipating...

<strong>things i am looking forward to:/strong>
<ol>
	<li>seeing both "primer" and "i heart huckabees" in a theater near me soon and very soon...</li>
	<li>the new relient k record...to be released in a less than a month...</li>
	<li>voting confidently for my choice of who should be the next president...or waking up, going to work, coming home and realizing i forgot it was election day altogether...whatever comes first...</li>
	<li>visiting any and/or all of my long distant friends sometime in the near future...</li>
	<li>rockin' out with all my new pedals, gadgets, gizmos and other fun things i have recently acquired for my guitar tonite at the sixforty building...</li>
	<li>singing along to my new rascal flatts cd as i drive home from work on this wonderful fall afternoon...</li>
	<li>and lastly but not leastly...i am looking forward to greeting a fresh, new, lovely weekend with arms outstretched and all tingly like...</li>
</ol>
that is all...good day...
