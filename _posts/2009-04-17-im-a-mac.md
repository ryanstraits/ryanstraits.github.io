<p>i've officially converted.</p>
<p>last week i became the proud owner of a 24" iMac. this screen is larger than life, friends. i don't even know how i'll begin to find things to fill up it's 2,304,000 pixels of glorious color.</p>
<p>i've got a few ideas, though.</p>
<p>i know i'm several years behind in the mac fad. i've historically lagged behind the trends. i got a super nintendo when nintendo 64 came out, for instance. i didn't get an ipod until 2006 (yes, that is in the current century). and i <em>still</em> don't have an iphone. get with the program, eh? well, my contract is up next year.</p>
<p>one apple at a time, folks, one at a time.</p>
<p>i'm 27 years old...and i am now a mac.</p>
