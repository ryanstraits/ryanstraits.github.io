we live in a fallen world...

<!-- break -->

i think in some part of us we all know that this much is true...behind the sunny optimism and cheery smiles...we all know that this isn't how it was intended to be...there's something about this world...something about the actions of the beings that inhabit it...something about the horrible tragedies that seem to befall even the most innocent of us...that just seems so...unnatural...

and what to that? what to the hurt we feel...the hurt we cause...what is there to say to the loss of a loved one...a close friend...a child?...knowing that they can never have that life back again..."hey sorry about your loss"..."hey i'll pray for you"...what meaningless, trivial, cliche words could we ever hope to string together to help assuage someone's grief...we weren't meant to deal with this...it's...unnatural...

what to the thousands of children abused and abandoned by the ones who they rely on for protection and survival...or the fact that the majority of our world is impoverished and starving...what about the ones that are trusted with authority

it's at this point that something in the back of our minds whispers, "this isn't right"...

we live in a broken world...

grace...mercy...forgiveness...consolation...how powerful these can be...because we are all human after all...we are all broken...we are all fallen...there is none greater than the next...

<em>we live in a beautiful world...yea we do...yea we do...</em>
