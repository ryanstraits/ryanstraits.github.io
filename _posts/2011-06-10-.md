<p>1. Fixed gear bicycles - Or fixies, for short. I know they're hip 'n all, but you'd almost think the iPad-lugging kids who ride them have something against technology. A little something called a "sprocket cassette" was invented a long while ago to make riding your bicycle easier. It's great actually: you can shift gears, go faster, go longer. Believe me, you hipsters need all the help you can get riding in those skinny jeans of yours.</p>
<p>2. People who don't recycle -Â </p>
<p>3. Famous actors agreeing to do horrible movies - I'm looking at you, Jim Carrey ("Mr. Popper's Penguins"), and you, Kevin James ("Zookeeper"). These movies look <em>awful</em>. Are you guys really that desperate for money?</p>
<p>10. Women</p>
