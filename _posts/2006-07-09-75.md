updation rules the nation...

papers, finals, projects...how dare they intrude upon this sacred summer season? it's a travesty indeed...come december, however, and i will finally have the upper hand...what a blessed day that will be...

the good news for now is that summer session 2 is nearly done...unfortunately, summer session 3 is beginning the week after...and that one will be taking me away from six:forty for around five weeks...so this will be my last week playing music and things of that sort...make sure to stop by the newly created <a href="http://www.myspace.com/sixfortyband" target="_new">six:forty band myspace page</a> for some possible exclusive updates during my hiatus...

in other music news...state bird is taking flight and playing several shows in the area soon and very soon so be sure to stop by the ol' <a href="http://www.myspace.com/statebird" target="_new">myspace</a> to check out the dates...most notably the one next sunday, july 16th at the outreach center (formerly the dover bomb shelter) in dover...it will be the cd release show so everyone come out and buy the album so coby and jared can make rent...or go <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;ih=018&amp;item=280004881937&amp;rd=1&amp;sspagename=STRK%3AMESE%3AIT&amp;rd=1" target="_new">here</a> and put a bid on jared's guitar...either/or...

alright enough with all the shameless self-promotion...hopefully this next summer session affords me more time to take better care of this site...if not then life must go on...don't wait up for me, xanga...

don't tread on me either...cuz that may smart a little...
