<em>"you're not just anyone...you're my ladder to the sun..."</em>

the holy-days are now upon us...for me this means family-gatherings that involve the exchanging of gifts, long lost friends returning home for a short span, and many-a-day off from slaving away at this computador...if that doesn't make for some holy days i don't know what will...i'm looking forward to them with much anticipation...

some time ago i thought about how much i want to be a kid again...that i'd give anything to be rid of the many responsibilites and anxieties that i face from day to day...and i'd give anything to have that child-like <span style="color:#409fff;">innocence</span> back again...i thought back to the times where christmas meant getting loads of toys and the days after were speant putting them together and playing with them until physically sick...i felt it should be a travesty to be forced to buy gifts for others and actually enjoy doing it just because i've passed a certain age...well, this weekend i finally realized something...those of us who are in the place i'm at in life really are just <span style="color:#6699ff;">children with grown-up faces</span>...they say that we're at an acceptable age to start a family but are we really ready? i still view myself as a kid...i still try to dress like a kid...i even feel as if i'm still viewed as a kid by others...but now i'm expected to raise a kid at my age? you see, we are still coming to terms with life...we still have <span style="color:#6699ff;">no understanding</span> of the consequences to our actions...we take on complex responsibilities but forsake the <span style="color:#80bfff;"><span style="color:#409fff;">simpler</span> </span>and more imporant ones...we are constantly looking to the next day...the day when we'll be grown up...the day when everything will fall into place for us...the day we arrive...when in actuality if we would take the time to look around we would quickly realize that that day is <span style="color:#6699ff;">today</span>...we've spent our childhood years dreaming and waiting for the days when we would be grown up but we'll spend the rest of our lives dreaming and telling others of the days when we were young...<span style="color:#6699ff;">today</span> is the day to go out and make the difference we've spent our lives up until this point dreaming about and the day we'll spend the rest of our lives talking about...

go get'm gumshoes...

and a happy holidays to you and yours...may they not be tinted orange...by omninous threats of terror and biological war...

yeah i'm retarded...
