hmmm...so what's new...well i got a new effects pedal for my bass guitar and i'm much excited about it...it's a digitech bp200 (i'm sure that means diddly-squat to yah) and the sound's coming out of it aren't quite amazing but definitely a step-up from the low-end box i used to kick around and call a pedal...i am also eyeing a new ampeg 100 watt 15" amp for my next gear-related purchase...and yes this will be the first "actual" amp i've ever owned...and you all me pegged for a bass aficionado...fools...

well all the terrorists (as i call them) have deserted sugarcreek for the most part...the 'crick is back to the ghost town it is for the other 51 weeks out of the year...and the funny thing is i saw more amish people out today than i did all last week...those amish people are smarter than we give them credit for...they know it's time to hide out when the out of towners ravage our little berg...but unfortunately they also know when to venture out and let their horses crap all over our roads...

i'm going to end my entry with a segment i haven't done in quite some time (and maybe have never done before...i forget)...it's called "things that ryan has recently come to like that you should like as well" and i hope to do it more often...so sit back, read, laugh, and then do as i do...
