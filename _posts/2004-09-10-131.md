well it's obvious that my serious entries are not nearly as popular with my readers...so in a return to form of sorts...here's me being a funny guy...or attempting to be...only you can be the judge...

<strong>random christian rap lyric of the day</strong>

back in place
and i'm all up in yo face
with a rhyme that i embrace
like a mother 2 her child
i'm kickin' it jesus style
2 the ones that think they heard
i did use the j-word
cuz i ain't 2 soft 2 say it
even if dj's don't play it

uhuh...how bout that...just keepin' it real over here...notice that i changed all the to's and too's to 2's in true rap form...

i think i have that entire "free at last" album memorized folks...it's a sad thing indeed, when you can remember needless rap verses but can't remember important things...like people's names and important dates in history and the like...

word 2 tha father...

<strong>yet another reason to not vote for john kerry</strong>

i flipped by trl yesterday and saw that paris hilton was on...before i lunged for the remote to change the channel and subsequently begin dry heaving...i made out what good ol' paris' shirt said..."john kerry is a rockstar"...yipes...voting for john kerry has officially become the chic thing to do...and as a result, i'm officially scared for this nation...and have now begun dry heaving...

<strong>notable quotes</strong>

“i think you can narrow it down to five words: hollywood’s running out of ideas" <em>- quote from an article on foxnews.com referring to the 4th sequel in the "chucky" movie series...yes...sequels are horribly out of control...something needs to be done immediately...</em>

"too many ob/gyn's aren't able to practice their love with women all across this country" <em>- george w. on the current state of our healthcare system...haha...good ol' g-dub...gotta love the guy...even if he doesn't make it as president for another term i'm sure he'll get loads of gigs for public speaking...</em>

<em>and now...back by popular demand...
</em><strong>thoughts of a passerby</strong>

"holy crap...it's raining...i'm sure the roads are as slick as ice...cuz that's what ice is, yah know...frozen rain...i better slow down to 10 mph below the speed limit..."

"hmmm...this guy is tailing me...i wonder if that means he wants me to go faster...naaah...he doesn't look like he has anywhere important to go..."

"using my keen sense of distance judgment i have determined that 50 feet is plenty of room to pull out in front of this fast approaching car..."
