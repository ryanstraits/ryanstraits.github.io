my life now sits in boxes in the corners of my room....

<!-- break -->

the majority of the "big move" is over...the brunt of the storm has passed...now we've just gotta organize and clean up the aftermath...as for me i need to find some new furniture for my room...and i gotta get used to these cotton pickin' new sheets...i <em>hate</em> new sheets...all hard and rough like...but unfortunately it's fashion over function with my mom...aka the home designer nazi...

but alas life is good in the new digs...it's been a long, arduous weekend...but things are falling into place...and i'm thankful for my new home...

<strong><span style="color:#009999;">---</span></strong>

<em>and now let the random musings begin...</em>

i saw the first big blockbuster of the summer friday nite...and it has gotten me <em>very</em> pumped for this whole coming movie season...that's right...i saw <strong><span style="color:#009999;">episode three</span></strong>...and i have now determined that this whole <strong><span style="color:#009999;">star wars</span></strong> phenomena is so much <em>more</em> than mere movies could ever contain...they are epic in scope...mythic in structure...and just plain mesmerizing to behold...i need to see them all again...and that right soon...

the <strong><span style="color:#009999;">lost</span></strong> season finale is this wed. nite...i shall be blocking off the<em> entire</em> evening for the event...it's going to be so good that they had to make it <em>two hours</em> in length...either that or they had to make it that long to compete with the two hr. finale of american idol...if so, then i now have muchos gratitude for network competition...

tomorrow morning at roughly 10AM i will have in my possession four tickets to see <strong><span style="color:#009999;">coldplay </span></strong>utterly annihilate everyone in attendance at the post-gazette pavilion in pittsburgh this coming august...that's right <em>four</em> tickets...and there's only one me...so let the bribes and buttering up begin...

<strong><span style="color:#009999;">sidenote:</span> </strong>let's all give a hardy "amen" to memorial day weekend...oh, the sweet bliss of a paid holiday...

i have finally gotten new batteries for my digital camera so expect many new <strong><span style="color:#009999;">pictures </span></strong>on this site soon...this will most likely include a new <strong><span style="color:#009999;">site design</span></strong> and <span style="color:#009999;"><strong>layout</strong></span>...*gasp*...

hold onto your nates folks...cuz this summer's gonna kick arse...

<strong><span style="color:#009999;">---</span></strong>

it's just about time to go home...and so the rain begins to pour...
