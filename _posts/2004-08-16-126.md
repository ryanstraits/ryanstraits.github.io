well i certainly had an eventful weekend...a little more frenzied that normal, but definitely more enjoyable...at least in comparison with past weekends which have been mostly comprised of me doing a great deal of nothing...like redesigning my xanga...which i seem to have done again...and it just so happens to be various shades of pink and purple...enjoy that while you can...i'm sure one of these days i'll wake up and wonder when my appreciation for color design flew so far off the map...and it will all point back to this day...

the day bluestarmorning went pink...

friday night i saw napoleon dynamite w/ <a href="http://www.xanga.com/elaineraemast" target="_blank">elaine</a> and her friend brooks...pretty great flick i must say...especially for it being a debut by a young director (and his wife i gotta add)...i thought it was well done and quite comical...very impressive for a novice filmmaker...however, i do think it was a little too overdone...it seemed like he was trying too hard to give it a wes anderson-like feel...which i very much enjoy, don't get me wrong...but anderson just seems to pull that off effortlessly (it is "his style" after all)...this movie felt like it was trying too hard to achieve that cult vibe and in the process it overshot it's mark...the characters seemed a bit too outlandish...anderson has a knack for making his characters quirky but still grounded in reality...these characters seemed too detached from their surroundings (although it was set in idaho...you can't blame them i guess)...which definitely made the movie hilarious...but too unreal to resound much with me...but hey who am i to compare this up against anderson's movies? that may not have been the directors intention at all...but after seeing the film and the cult-like status rising up around it...it's hard to believe that that wasn't their aim...

two interesting notes on the movie that <a href="http://www.xanga.com/weakfingers" target="_blank">andrew</a> and i figured out together today...1.) the popular, class-president candidate girl was played by hillary duff's older sister oddly enough (who i'm sure is trying very hard to make a name for herself apart from hillary...but yea like i care)...and 2.) the girl who played their little friend with the 80's spandex wardrobe was the little girl with the map on her back in waterworld...pretty crazy stuff i must say...next time on "when film worlds collide" we'll visit the set of alien vs. predator and interview the hollywood halfwit (and now millionaire) who thought up this inane concoction...

and now we come to the portion of my entry where i admit...yes...i do enjoy the olympics...in fact...i'm really looking forward to the synchronized diving and swimming competitions tonight...hey these things only come around once every four years folks...and when else are you going to get a chance to enjoy synchronized diving in this capacity?...c'mon now...

<em>and now the triumphant return of the ever-popular, always-insightful:</em>
<strong>thoughts of a passerby</strong>

"oh no...it's a cop...let's slow down to 10 mph below the speed limit...we won't look guilty then..."

"ha! do these people think i don't notice their cars lurching forward as they hit their brakes 50 ft. in front of me? little do they know i have the speedblaster 2000x radar and i can clock them a mile away...muwahahaha! suckers..."

<strong>ryan's elocutionary snafu of the night</strong>

while discussing movies, music and other cultural happenings with my good friends seth, sally and jenny o, i asked if anyone had seen that new amish reality show...met by red-faces and a good many snickers, i apparently referred to it as "amish in the sh*tty"...

oopsie daisie...

any attempts to keep the night PG flew right out the window at that point...just leave it to a show involving amish people to totally veer our delightful evening into complete and utter moral degradation...
