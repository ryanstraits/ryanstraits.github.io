the latest album from coldplay has been unleashed on the world today...

<!-- break -->

needless to say i would highly recommend it to all of you who enjoy incredible sounding and intensely moving music...and since i'm so frickin' cool (please note picture to the left for confirmation of this) and have several shifty dealings in the seedy underworld of music piracy...i've had this album for a whole week and can rightly attest to it's brilliance...it's a must-have folks...and a definite top five for 2005...barring a monsoon or the loss of several key limbs necessary to get me to a music store...i will be purchasing it tonight at my earliest convenience...

and for those wondering i did indeed score four great seats (four rows behind the vip section) to see these guys in concert this august in pittsburgh...if it's anything like the last time i saw them i'm pretty sure i'll be blown away once again...so do yourself another favor and do whatever you can to catch them live as it's an experience unlike anything else you've seen...that i guarantee...

oh and if you're needing a ticket...i still have one left...and yes i'm still accepting bribes in excess of $100 and offers from anyone wanting to wash and wax my car...

ok enough with the stumping, ryan...like these guys really need help selling records or tickets to their shows...not only is this blind fanaticism getting the best of me lately...but it's making me become increasingly violent to naysayers...

so anyways...go out and buy this album...before i punch you...
