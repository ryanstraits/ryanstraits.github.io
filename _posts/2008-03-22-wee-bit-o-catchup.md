<p>before i [re]kick this thing back off, a few orders of business:</p>
<ol>
<li>first off, this hummingbird theme is a template. an original one should be coming shortly. but do enjoy it's spring-y flavor in the meantime.</li>
<li>i'm not an everyday poster. however, i did pay some money for this so i'm hoping that encourages me to post what i will now refer to as "frequently".</li>
<li>the goal of this site is to inject some creativity back into my daily routine. i've lacked a creative outlet for several months now and i feel it's negatively affecting my q of l. that would be my quality of life, fyi. lol brb</li>
<li>my other goal in this is to begin being more honest with myself (and others) about myself. my previous b-log lacked alot of my truest feelings due to what i perceived the reactions of the people reading it would be. in two years time i've learned to not care as much about those reactions.</li>
<li>in addition, i'm also keenly aware that there's a high probability that i will be the only one reading this anyways.</li>
</ol>
<p>so there's that.</p>
