Before I [re]kick this thing back off, a few orders of business:

+ First off, this hummingbird theme is a template. An original one should be coming shortly. But I do enjoy it's spring-y flavor in the meantime.
+ I'm not an everyday poster. However, I did pay some money for this so I'm hoping that encourages me to post what I will now refer to as "frequently".
+ The goal of this site is to inject some creativity back into my daily routine. I've lacked a creative outlet for several months now and I feel it's negatively affecting my q of l. That would be my quality of life, FYI. LOL BRB
+ My other goal in this is to begin being more honest with myself (and others) about myself. My previous b-log lacked a lot of my truest feelings due to what I perceived the reactions of the people reading it would be. In two years time I've learned to not care as much about those reactions.
+ In addition, I'm also keenly aware that there's a high probability that I will be the only one reading this anyways.

So there's that.
