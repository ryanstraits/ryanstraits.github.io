what a week it's been...

christmas always seems to come and go in a whirlwind and i never truly get to enjoy it...last weekend was mostly spent w/ friends who are all home for the holidays...it was great to see and spend time w/ them all...this week was the annual crescendo leading up to the always climactic christmas day...my body was the first to give me any presents this season...how thoughtful of it to give me the flu just in the nick of time for christmas...it knows how much i enjoy being sick and feeling disgustingly awful for the holidays...how wonderful...i did manage to get through christmas and christmas eve without feeling so bad that i couldn't participate in anything and i came out of most of the symptoms just in time to head to new york city with my family friday morning...we made a last second decision to go along w/ some family friends and spend the weekend there...it ended up being a really great trip and felt like an extended christmas celebration w/ my family...we stayed in the marriott marquis hotel right in times square (right next to mtv studios for those of you who care...no carson sitings to report however...dang) and did the usual sightseeing thing, caught a broadway show and all that fun stuff...the city was getting pretty insane in preparation for new years eve...i couldn't imagine being there then...we would have been right in the heat of all that if we woulda stayed there...it was crazy enough as it was without the extra 500,000 people that will be showing up there new years eve...yikes...

while i was there i felt the city beckoning me...it would be so interesting to live there although i'm sure my smalltown self would feel out of place pretty quick...there's just so much going on there that there would never be a dull moment like here in ol' rural ohio...but it became evident to me that though there are millions of people there it seems like one of the lonliest places on the planet and even though there is so much going on there is also so much going wrong...even still, it wonders me if i could make it there or not...

i would like to venture back there again sometime with some friends and check out the hot spots in the city that aren't highlighted much as tourist attractions such as: soho, the east village, tribeca, etc...we'll see i guess...maybe i'll be just too tempted to stay if i ever go back...

have a happy and safe new years everyone...i pray the brand new year will bring you all closer with God than years previous...
