so this is about my 3rd attempt to write a new entry...i really have been trying...i just haven't been actually coming through...i started writing a long drawn-out entry yesterday but realized that it applied alot more to the afore-to-mentioned "uber-entry"...so i decided that it will be included in said entry...which shall be completed at a later date...most likely right after i get done doing a a fine bit of ice skating in a lovely place called hades...

tonite should be a darn good time...i'm going up to akron with a few kids to catch lovedrug for their cd release show...i haven't seen them live in a very long time (let alone any concert in a really long time)...but i have had the cd for well over a year (shhh dont' tell anyone)...and it is AMAZING...so good that i decided to type "amazing" in all uppercase in what would have otherwise been an all lowercase entry...it's just that good...

i really wanted to check out "the village" tonite though...i'm a huge fan of m. night shyamalan's work...the reviews for it haven't been the best but his movies never seem to review well...so what can you expect...i hope to catch it sunday nite...anybody up for going with me since all my friends are blowing it tonite?

so what about tomorrow you ask? well...tomorrow is right out...i'm starting my day off in the late morning...transporting all our musical equipment from the six:forty building over to our church...setting it up...playing like 15 to somewhere around 300 songs for a prayer/worship night for our young marrieds (which i'm excited about being able to do, don't get me wrong, but it's just gonna be alot of work and is looking to be one heck of a long day)...then tearing it all down...taking it back to our building...and having to do practice yet again on sunday for worship at six:forty this coming tuesday...it's gonna be one long, worship-filled weekend...which oddly enough should sound like a good thing...and i'm sure it will be...but as we're told(and i'll be taking it in the most literal sense this weekend)..."worship demands a sacrifice"...

i apologize if this entry feels like a schoolgirl blandly telling her lifes events to her diary or what have you...but my mind, body and even soul are pretty much shot from work today...i spent most of the day cleaning/moving/organizing/reorganizing our engineering lab at work which contains file cabinets upon file cabinets chalked full of drawings that date back to slightly before the invention of the wheel...ok maybe not that far...but definitely before the invention of the computer...which was a REALLY long time ago in case you wondered...

see there i go with the caps again...somebody stop me...please...

i know only one thing that can solace me at this moment...a hefty dose of the 'drug baby....

the lovedrug...
