Well, at least it has been for me.

Lately I've been intentionally going out of my way to de-tangle the complex interweavings of what has become my life. It's not an easy thing to do, I'll tell you that. A lot of times it requires that you have to say no to many good, yea, even great things. And I, myself, have a hard time doing just that. Unfortunately, it's taken me 25+ years to figure that out. 

I once heard a story about the philosopher <a href="http://en.Wikipedia.Org/wiki/voltaire" target="_blank">Voltaire</a> and how he scoffed at Isaac Newton's hypothesis that man would one day travel over 40mph (this was back in the olden days, mind you). He claimed that man's heart would stop at such <a href="http://www.Youtube.Com/watch?V=hb7tc9pvvyg" target="_blank">ludicrous speeds</a> (ha!). And of course Christians love this story because Voltaire was supposedly an atheist and his home would later be used to print Bibles out of. Chalk one up for the good guys.

The funny thing is, there's some truth to Voltaire's statement. Think of how much we cram into our lives now that we can zip around town at the push of a pedal and can get our work done at the click of a button. How much more stuff do we tack on to our schedules just because we can fit it in? I'm beginning to be of the mindset that our human bodies and minds just weren't meant to handle such a toll. Maybe that Voltaire fellow wasn't so crazy after all.

In fact, wouldn't our lives be so much fuller if we worked more on sharing our time and spent it less?
