<p>a bigger blog will be shortly coming. i've got to at least get one a month to justify having this site. you may be thinking: that doesn't justify you having this site. and you'd also be correct. but still, i continue to humor myself.<br /><br />this past weekend i humored myself by flying out to the pacific northwest to visit a few good old friends. it was short but most infinitely sweet. i had a blast and a half to say the least and a full two blasts to say the most. <br /><br />instead of recounting my entire trip via words and clever phrases i am uploading a gaggle of photos that i snapped with my camera-equipped phone. most of them didn't turn out half-bad. the rest turned out full on bad, but again, i continue to humor myself by posting them anyways. these pics can be found safely tucked within the cleverly titled "photos" page.<br /><br />lastly, i cheated once again and did not design the layout to this site. but it looks darn cool doesn't it?<br /></p>
