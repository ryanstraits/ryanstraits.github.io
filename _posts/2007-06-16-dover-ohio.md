well here we go...<br /><br />the big tour has officially begun...the discover america/winston jazz routine/state bird summer tour...although, i'm still at home...in my pajamas...typing on my computer...buuuut this afternoon we take off for lands unknown...the great wide wonder that is the u. s. of a...from sea to shining sea...<br /><br />i've kind of forsaken this whole world known as digital bloggery for a good little spell...but in the hopes of keeping a daily (or close to it) log of the happenings of our life on the road for future nostalgic purposes i'm attempting at resurrecting my journaling sensibilities...i apologize in advance to anyone outside of myself that may end up reading this...<br /><br />alright well i've got to keep this short...i haven't actually packed yet...i keep putting it off because i don't know how to pack for being on the road for three weeks...i think i'll just blindly throw clothes out of my drawers and into my suitcase...tonight we play at a place called the "bellville opera house" in bellville, ohio...it's a small town just outside mansfield where our fine friends "the winston jazz routine" hail from...this is going to be their cd release show and what a fine cd it is i must say...i feel honored to be their friends and to have gotten a chance to lend a little helping hand to one song on the album...i highly recommend you pick it up...you can do so here: <a href="http://www.merchline.com/therecordmachine/">http://www.merchline.com/therecordmachine/</a><br /><br />ok friendly band plugging aside...for the kickoff show last night we played at the renovare cafe in dover...the whole night consisted of somewhere in the region of 7-9 bands or so...it was quite a great night...thanks to all who came out and stuck around for us last three bands (the schedule was running a bit behind)...but it was good to have such a large turnout and see all our friends before we take off...our sets were a little rough but they usually always are at the start of a tour...it's going to be crazy playing a show every night of the week for the next two weeks...which also means i get to hear the fine music of the winston jazz routine and discover america every night as well...what a treat...<br /><br />ok, time to get to that packing...thanks to all those of you keeping us in your thoughts and prayers while we're on the road...<br /><br />God bless,<br />ryan
