ok so i'm done trying to make every entry i post an epic event...i'm done stressing out about how i'm going to make every word hilarious or poignant...there will be times for those...but not ALL the time...and it's hard to make time to type up those posts anyways...they're far too exhausting...so here is a entry filled with various random thoughts that require no effort whatsoever...and there will be no explanations for their meanings...turn back now...or be forever changed...

i am mourning the end of "amish in the city"...but when something great ends another is bound to begin...and boy has that never been more true...tonite's the season 4 premiere of the one and only "smallville"...8pm...the wb...be there...

troy and i have been working hard on designing the new sound setup and stage design respectively for the new six:forty meeting center/place/room/etc...and it's going pretty well except we've just discovered that the room has the acoustics of the swiss alps...

"there are two kinds of people in this world...those who love neil diamond and those who don't..."

i realized that the fair was in town when i stopped by walmart last nite and there were actually parking spots available...and hey what's with them not carrying the new chris tomlin cd but instead having numerous copies of the john tesh worship album? yes apparently ol' john "piano by the sea" tesh has jumped on the worship bandwagon now...i think that's officially a sign that the whole thing's a tad over-saturated...but what do i know...

i hate school...and frankly don't wish to go tonite...or ever again for that matter...

i've been making significant headway with recording these past few weeks...i have one song nearly completed...well i almost have all the tracking completed...which isn't that close to being done i guess...but so far everything is sounding good to my ears...i don't know what i'll do with it when i'm done...i haven't thought that far ahead yet...i haven't even thought of a name for this new song...it's clocking in at around 8 minutes long though...i have a tendency towards epics i guess...the tentative title at this point is: "and the evening and the mourning were the first day"...

however...the biggest foil to my recording endeavors would be my purchase of a truly excellent xbox game...i picked up burnout 3 two weeks ago...and boy is it ever sweet...however i fear that i've become a significantly worse driver because of it...

i'd like a side of freedom fries with that please...

i took a little <a href="http://www.ontheissues.org/Quiz.htm" target="_blank">quiz online</a> to see who i most lined up with on the issues this election...one thing i found quite funny was that both g-dub and j-ker were at the very bottom of the list...i stand for nothing close to what either of them believe in...however i was surprised that the politician i most closely matched was dick cheney...yipes...well at least everyone knows now that i'm not an extremist...so there...

fyi...the swiss alps do not have good acoustics...

speaking of swiss...the aptly titled "swiss festival" is next weekend...the very peak of the festival world...and it's in lil ol' sugarcreek, ohio...polka dancing...apple dumplings...cheese...the mouse game...people dressed in funny swiss suits...cheese...the steinstossen...and most importantly...cheese...and the gravitron...

conga drums are not bongos...and i'd appreciate it if you wouldn't refer to them as such...

if you're a fan of relient k like i am...then you're anticipating the release of their latest album on nov. 2nd...until that day, however, you can preview 3 songs from said new album at <a href="http://www.mmhmm.com" target="_blank">www.mmhmm.com</a> and <a href="http://www.purevolume.com/relientk" target="_blank">www.purevolume.com/relientk</a> ...ch-ch-check it out...

the time is now 4:24pm...do you know where your icbm's are?

serious, poignant and hilarious things to come shortly...stay tuned...
