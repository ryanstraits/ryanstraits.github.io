it was really nice to get one good night's sleep at home in ohio sat.. night/sun morning...i slept in til around 11am or so, did some laundry and then repacked into a smaller bag...i had just enough time to enjoy dinner w/ my folks before heading to the guy's house to get ready to take off for virginia...<br /><br />coby returned the uhaul trailer because there was only going to be 6 of us and a lot less gear for the last week of the tour...he also managed to get the a/c fixed in the van so that was a definite plus...unfortunately, ashten wasn't able to make the last leg of the tour with us due to a wedding...she's definitely missed...<br /><br />we headed out for harrisonburg around 3pm and got in at close to 9pm...it was a pretty good haul to down there...we were playing kind of a last minute house show at our good friends' ryan and dustin miller's house...we played probably our worst set of the tour so far...we all took our shirts off and were generally acting like idiots the entire time...so that definitely factored in...but it was still fun...our friends dave, marcie and sarah all made the trek down from ohio as well to be there so it was good to see all of them...<br /><br />after getting a good night's rest at the miller's spacious house we packed up the next afternoon for our show in virginia beach/norfolk...
