<em>hope is a good thing...maybe the best of things...and no good thing ever dies...</em>

<!-- break -->

pretty amazing flick...probably one of my all time faves...i'm not a huge tim robbins fan...but having frank darabont's name attached more than makes up for any qualms i have with robbins...he's just a flat out great screenwriter (curses to you lucas for not liking his script for indy 4...he did, however, pen the new mission:impossible script and is currently adapting/directing a remake of "fahrenheit 451"...the man has chops)...kudos to darabont for writing a part that actually makes robbins likeable as well...and then of course, there's the incomparable morgan freeman...that man can act...although his career has been filled with just about as many misses as it has hits...

so, for those of you who haven't seen shawshank...i suggest you see it soon...for those of you in the central ohio region...you may know that it was filmed locally in mansfield, ohio...to you i suggest that you visit the old mansfield reformatory where it was filmed...it is a very incredible structure...we headed up there for the haunted house they put on every october last sat. nite...being in an old, decrepit prison was freaky enough...regardless of the fact there of course were the obligatory punks paid to jump out at you...we all decided that we want to head back for a full tour of the prison in the daytime...what a fascinating place...i just ordered the shawshank special edition dvd off amazon...needless to say i'll be consumed with the bonus features as soon as it arrives...

thanks for the outpouring of wonderful thoughts and relatable "wisdom" from my last post...if nothing else it lets me know that i'm not the only one that feels such things...i hope to post more on matters in that same vein soon...there are a few noteworthy things happening in my little world that may give way to some larger working...and that's exciting stuff right there...it's one step at a time, folks...

one...step...at...a...time...

the only thing i'm looking forward to more than getting this dang election (and those pesky, ever-cirulating campaign ads) over with...is the season premiere of "the oc" next thursday evening...they've made us wait far too long...oh yea...and <a href="http://www.mmhmm.com" target="_blank">these guys</a> are coming out with a phenomenal new disc as well...

this weekend i do believe i am going to take in a rather scary-looking flick...and then partake in a "haunted trail" festivity being put on by our church's youth group both sat. and sun. night out in the creepy woods of podunkville...should be the makin's for a fine and frightening halloween weekend...the first for me in a great while...with the haunted house last weekend..."saw" friday nite...and scaring the bejesus outta a whole load of high school twerps sat. and sun. nites...i should be just about caught up on all the halloweenin' fun that i've missed out on the past few years...

<strong>...and now a word on legalism and such like</strong>

a preacher was completing a temperance sermon...

with great expression he said, "if i had all the beer in the world, i'd take it and throw it into the river..."

with even greater emphasis he said, "and if i had all the wine in the world, i'd take it and throw it into the river..."

and then finally, he said, "and if i had all the whiskey in the world, i'd take it and throw it into the river..."

he sat down.

the head elder then stood and announced, "for our closing song, let us sing hymn 365, 'shall we gather at the river'..."

on a more serious note...here's a great <a href="http://www.relevantmagazine.com/article.php?sid=4956" target="_blank">article</a> from relevantmagazine.com on culture and it's role in christianity, etc...it offers a pretty good take on the "gray issues" of our christian walk for any of you that struggle with that sort of thing...heh...

<em>prepare yourself...it's the triumphant, yet anticlimactic return of...</em>

<em>
</em><strong>thoughts of a passerby</strong>

"i believe that i need to just about come to a complete stop before i can successfully make this right hand turn..."

"ok, if i swing wide into the other lane and totally disregard oncoming and trailing traffic i'll be lined up perfectly for my garage when i make this turn into my driveway..."
