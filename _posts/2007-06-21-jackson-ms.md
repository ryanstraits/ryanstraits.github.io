what do you call an egg on the beach?<br /><br />a sandy eggo...<br /><br />not make sense? that's because it's supposed to be a waffle on the beach...but twjr's nate messed it up from the stage a few nights back and hasn't lived it down yet...chris has since came up with his own clever version of the joke:<br /><br />what do you call a hamburger on the beach?<br /><br />a sandy patty...<br /><br />fun times from the road...right now we're hanging out at "the pour cafe" in tuscaloosa, alabama...we just got some free pizza and we're in air conditioning...a very welcome respite from the confines of our steamy van...i think it's in the 90's today...the humidity doesn't seem too bad but that really doesn't mean much down here in the south...<br /><br />last night we played in jackson, ms...i was trying to figure out if that's where johnny cash and june carter were wanting to go in that song of theirs...nate quinn seems to think it was jackson, tennessee...either way, we had a good time down in this jackson...the show was at a place called "swell 'o venue"...i already made a few jokes about it's name in yesterday's post so i'll spare'm today...it was actually a pretty cool place...it was a venue/skate park/skate shop/coffee shop...a very interesting concoction for sure...<br /><br />the show was set up by a guy named dan who's a friend of chris' and currently plays in a great band called questions in dialect...he was a very nice guy...we had a pretty decent turnout for the show and actually played outside in the skate park...our set spawned a deep south dance party spearheaded by chris and the jazz boys...it had all the makings of a hoedown although it didn't quite reach that level...it was fun nonetheless...<br /><br />dan got us a place to stay at another member of questions in dialects' apartment...i forget his name but it was a pretty small place and we all had to cram in on the floor...they had a swimming pool at their complex though which more than made up for that in my mind...<br /><br />tonight promises to be another good show...we're up first though and i need to get set up...<br /><br />there are some pics from last night's show up on the flickr site...<br /><br />until next time...
