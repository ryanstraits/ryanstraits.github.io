<em>i wish we could open our eyes...to see in all directions at the same time...</em>

<!-- break -->

well...what is there to say...it is indeed time for a new post...i think i run them a bit too ragged...but there is nothing new to speak of...nothing post-worthy anyways...so i guess i'll just blather on for a bit...

that sounded awfully like i'm talking in a british accent...and that's probably because i tend to think in one from time to time...just to mix things up you know...and then i can pull off saying words like blather...

well here's something of interest to some...tonight marked the first official practice of a rather exciting new band that i am proud to call myself apart of...it features a group of chaps i would venture to say are some of the finest musical talent this area has to offer...and i'm quite pleased with the way things are sounding after only one night fully assembled...

we're still feeling things out...but our direction is definitely clear...straight-up rock like you probably haven't heard before...yet with an air of familiarity i'd say...if that means anything at all...we have no name or anything concrete of that sort...but keep your ears and eyes peeled as we could be appearing at a few shows near you as soon as this fall...

well that is all the blather i can muster for this evening...

good day and cheerio (as well as other breakfast cereals if cheerios aren't your thing) ol' bean...

<em>oh what a beautiful view...if you were never aware of what was around you...</em>
