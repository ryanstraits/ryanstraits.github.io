today is 3/4/05...

check that out: 3-4-5...just think...there will never be another 03/04/05 ever again...i suppose this is the point where i say something contrived and quasi-inspiring to make you go live life like never before...or something to that effect...well i'm not...so don't get all hyped up...but i guess it is customary to make some form of a wish on a date of such exceeding magnitude...so i have a simple wish that i would like to be granted:

no more *bleep*ing snow please...

i abhor ohio...i'm officially to the point of utterly detesting this place and it's despicable weather patterns...it's march...you know...the month where spring comes...spring break...stuff like that...now bring it on dang it...

as you can see from above i've been on an oasis kick lately...taking me way back to jr. high...i tell yah...these guys have some pretty killer tunes...don't know what it is about them...catchy...darn catchy...

so maybe that's why everyone and their brother is covering their songs lately....but they're not that old of a band to be covered already...i can't say that i hate the covers...they're actually pretty good...ryan adams did a splendid, yet haunting rendition of "wonderwall" and i recently heard a cover of "champagne supernova" on the latest episode of the oc (great episode by the way...but i promised myself i wouldn't get into it...this week at least)...don't know who did it...but it was pretty good too...still doesn't explain why they're covering such recent material...crazy trends these days i tell yah...

yeeeaah...ok...let's wrap this lame-o entry up...

in other news...i've been a little behind on my review schedule but i did find time to do one last week for that "new keanu reeves movie"...haha...it's sposed to be all controversial n stuff...and i guess since i'm a christian i'm sposed to hate it...well i kinda liked it...my review sorta tipped a lil more towards the negative than i thought it was going to (and they thought of the title not me) but i'm falling into this sarcastic writing mode lately and i'm kinda liking it...so it's shown up in my last few reviews...maybe it's just a phase...nevertheless...<a href="http://www.the-review.com/archive/02262005/PDF/C05.pdf" target="_new">here's the review</a>...

3-4-5...go...
