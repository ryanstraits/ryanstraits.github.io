<p>So, while I've had a blog post idea in my head for running on 3 months now, the urge to sit down and actually write it out just hasn't been able to crack my air-tight schedule these last few months. I'm sad that this blog has gone by the wayside, but working 55-hour weeks at my new job, spending time w/ my girlfriend, flying home to Ohio for holidays, and working on the project that is the subject of this post has taken up the lion's share of my time recently.</p>
<p>The aforementioned project (<a href="http://uglychristmassweater.bandcamp.com">http://uglychristmassweater.bandcamp.com</a>) consists of a few traditional &amp; original Christmas songs that my roommate, Diego Chi, myself and two of our friends (Cayla Waller &amp; Rachel Devilbiss) put together in the weeks before Christmas. It was a blast to write and record music again, especially apart of a group. I hope to do much more of it in the future.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy, and that you and yours had yourself a merry, little Christmas!</p>
