lately i've come to find...that i'm caught up in the winds of life...

<!-- break -->

work is without purpose once again as this week i lost one of my only advocates here due to the traditionalistic minds of closeminded coworkers...dare anyone come in with a progressive agenda...dare we actually move forward, embrace technology and expand our horizons...no let's stay where we've always been and do things we've always done...and so the shuffled steps and hushed whispers in dark corners begin..."he's gone without a trace...we'll be better off without him"...and suddenly i remember why it is that i'll never stick around this one-horse town...

one by one and we're on to the next one...

i spend all day floating in front of this glowing box...yet i rejoice when that glorious bell chimes and i'm on my way to freedom...but so far these summer months have brought forth much more provocation than they have avocation...my life now consists of simple transitions from screen to shiny screen...weekends have turned into all-day studies...and late nights have been born out of endless homework sessions...i'm working for the future they say...i'm bettering myself for what lies ahead...but today is yesterday's tomorrow...

and today is fading fast...

as are any hopes of a social life...faintly i remember reaching for outstretched hands...watching as words are mouthed...hearing things like "fine", "good", and "great" coming from my lips before i can even rightly decide if that is indeed how i'm feeling...smiles are blurs as i devise, plan and structure at a frenzied pace...faces come and go that i wish i could pour my ever-elusive time into...but when the dust settles i'm left with only ringing ears and dampened spirits...it's surely a mystery how a man could enter the presence of so many acquaintances and leave a solitary stranger...

lately i've come to find...that maybe this problem is entirely mine...

<span style="color:#cc9966;">---</span>

but i'm reaching for <em>your</em> outstretched hands...and i'm beginning to hold on to the words <em>you</em> already said...
