i'm on...but i'm not here...

<!-- break -->

i just got on to burn a few cd's for my friend david hart and thought that i would write a short entry in the ol' journal...

i'm burning some fine cd's right now...sleeping at last's major label debut (i saw them at c-stone a few years back) and guster's newest release, "keep it together"...both cd's are/have lasted several weeks in my compact disc player...a fine accomplishment for any band...

last week was a fun-filled week but a busy one at that...my long-lost bud's <a href="http://www.xanga.com/dreamerswell" target="_blank">dave</a> and <a href="http://www.xanga.com/averagejoe" target="_blank">joe</a> are/were in town for the week and it was really good getting to catch up w/ them...this weekend i got to go skiing and catch some sun and mass amounts of soreness...my family borrowed a boat for the weekend and so my parents, my sis andÂ i all went out to tappan yesterday and enjoyed this amazing weather on the lake...good times were had by all...

i'm looking forward with great anticipation to my first paid holiday next monday...kind of ironical that that holiday is "labor day" and i will be performing no labor whatsoever and still getting paid for it...
