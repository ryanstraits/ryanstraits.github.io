<span style="font-family:Verdana;">listening to: brand new - good to know that if i ever need attention all i have to do is die</span>

happy mom's day to you all...hope you had a great day w/ the woman who brought you into this world...i know i did...and will tomorrow as well...i am going shopping with her...a little mother-son bonding...how quaint

i have been called back for a second interview on tuesday afternoon...yippee...which means i'm halfway to getting this job that will either make me or break me for this summer...depends on how you look at it i guess...keep me in your prayers if you could only be so kind...

today was an overall good day now that i think back on it...spent some time w/ my extended family during the day...talked to my good friend abby for the first time in a long time this afternoon (i miss the ol' days in the bookstore...ahh the memories)...i then played some sand volleyball while it was cold and windy out (didn't really feel quite right)...however the biggest news of the day is that i just bought tickets to see "the matrix 2" wed. night at 10:40pm! how rad is that?...pretty rad i must say...

and to all you drinkers, smokers, cussers, chewers, spitters and the like: i will not give you my opinion because you've already made up your mind...just remember this my friends,Â you kiss your mother with that mouth...
