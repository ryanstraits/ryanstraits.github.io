this was our third time as a band going through nashville while on tour but our first actual time playing here and let me tell ya...nashville didn't let us down...the place we played at was called "the 5 spot"...it was a very hip little bar in town...this was the nashville version of twjr's cd release show so alot of their friends from down here came...the place was pretty packed which made the show that much more fun...a very cool guy/band opened up for us...his stuff was very good...i believe his name was brian militana...<br /><br />i just started up a flickr account to house select photos that i've been taking from the tour...it seems to be the easiest way to share pics with you all...i tried to post some in the last blog entry but was getting all kinds of a hassle...this is much more simple...you can look at them here: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/9116489@N06/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/9116489@N06/</a> ...i'll let you know when i put new ones up...<br /><br />tonight we travel to chattanooga, tn to play...unfortunately we couldn't fit on the same bill as where twjr got booked so discover america and us are playing at a some form of a coffee bar maybe? the venue where twjr is playing sounds pretty cool...they're also playing with a guy by the name of aaron roche whose house i along w/ coby, matt and nate (from twjr) stayed at last night...he and his wife were kind enough to shack us up while a few of nate's other friends from down here housed the remaining members of the bands...but anyways...aaron is a fine singer and guitarist...i really wish i could catch his show...he played a while back at the renovare in dover and i really enjoyed it...oh well, maybe next time...<br /><br />over and out,<br />ryan
