i haven't done anything too worthwhile with myself lately and so i've had nothing to write about...

<!-- break -->

that really is a shame cuz i usually have so much to say...one worthwhile thing i did do was a review of switchfoot's new album in the "reviews" section of my journal...now this took me a good bit of time to complete and i wanted to make it look all professional so i am begging you to go check it out and post some comments on what you think and then go buy their album when it comes out this tuesday and tell me if my review was accurate enough for you...

i start my new job in 2 weeks so that will be crazy i think...if you think about it send up a flare prayer for me...i could use them...

tonite i think i will probly play a little phase 10 (our new obsession) and then i might go bowling...how fun...i need to enjoy these friday nites because i won't have much of them once i start my new job...*sniff*sniff*

hope you all enjoyed the list of how you know you're from tuscarawas county...it was compiled by some of my friends who are from missouri but have lived here for like 4-5 years and still complain about how boring it is here and how weird all us natives are...what a bunch of losers...but it's still funny...

be nice billy...
