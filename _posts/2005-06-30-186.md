<strong>the californian adventure 2005</strong>

<!-- break -->

ok so i promised a few cali stories...just a few...if you want a day by day chronicle you'll have to hunt me down and coax me with cookie dough ice cream...well maybe i'll settle for a few bottles of flavored aquafina water...

so while in mexico we headed down to this tourist trap town called ensenada (while there i suddenly realized how it felt to be one of the idiotic tourists who plague our area for the amish...and i felt dirty...very dirty...but that's probly because i never ceased to have sand between my toes)...anyways, a few of us guys were walking down the street when some amigo comes right up and asked if we were in the army...he most likely got the idea from my killer new haircut (reference pictures below)...dustin (the youth pastor), being the joker he is, said "yea, we're on leave"...so the man in perfect english...begins to lecture us in heightened tones of voice emphasized with perfect english curse words about how it's not right that we're fighting and dying for ol' g-dub...that he'd like to string said president up on the white house lawn...and that he had just got done typing the el presidente a letter and that he got so steaming mad he broke the "e" key off his laptop...we could hardly contain our laughter to say the least...when we finally were free of him...he saluted us and said "at ease gentlemen...semper fi...don't die"...

so there yah go anti-war folks...we've found your poster child...he's in mexico...and he's a lil loco...

oh alright...one more...last thursday we headed up to hell-a for a day of fun and frivolity...we were basically our own tour guides so not knowing much about the city we decided to hit up the oc first...ok...beautiful people...beaches...gated communities...way too many million dollar homes...moving on...next stop...hollywood boulevard...we hit all the tourist joints and then walked around the chinese and kodak theaters for a while...so when we got to the entrance of the kodak i saw that there was a film crew there...we perused around a little bit and i saw that they were taping a "tlc" show...yippee...i was kinda hoping it'd be like a movie or something of that sort...but the girls in the group were flipping out cuz they actually knew what the show was...of course me not even knowing what it was got asked first to actually be on the show...i signed the waiver form and then a few of the girls followed suit...i got in front of the camera...greeted the trendy looking host and had to guess some poor madeover girl's age and then talk about what i liked about her "hip, new look"...

so there you have it...my national television debut...if you're wanting to actually catch the show...make sure to watch "ten years younger" on tlc sometime around september or october...i expect calls from agents and networks to follow shortly...

and now some visual aides to guide you through my adventure...roll slideshow:
