<em>it's raining...it's boring...</em>

<!-- break -->

and i'm about to start snoring...it's friday afternoon...thank the lord it's nearly the weekend...i'm not excited about the rain...and i hope it not's boring...but i will look forward to the snoring...hopefully i will be doing alot of it this weekend...it will be a busy one at that unfortunately...unless this rain keeps up...that will eliminate mowing from my duties for tomorrow...so let's hope for that...

this has actually been one heck of a busy week...i can't complain though...school's done (of which i recieved a grade of "a" in my only class that i took this semester...that brings my gpa up to 3.46...woot)...work has been busy too...it's actually the first time in a long while that i've had a waiting list on projects to get done (which makes you wonder why i'm typing this right now and not working right? hmmm...yeah i'll have to think about that one)...and i'm sure it will only get worse as summer nears...i like it though...i like always knowing what i'm going to be doing when i come into work...i like the challenge...i like organizing myself to complete my given tasks...yup...the engineer in me is beginning to show...i'm officially becoming left-brained...please begin praying for me now...

i've officially turned to the dark side...

(ok...i figured out why i'm writing this and not working right now...maybe because i've been working all day and need a creative break...how's that? and you all thought i was lazy...pfffhhht...)

so...i don't know if any of you saw the season finale of "the oc" this past wed. nite...but the closing montage was amazing...i thought the show ended great...i know alot of people wanted it to end all cheery...but from a writing standpoint...it was masterfully done...everything ended as it begun...everything came full circle...and we're all left wondering what will happen next season...what better promotion could they have for the season opener next fall? i know smallville has done this every season...instead of wrapping up the storylines...it lets them hang right at that vital point...if they didn't do that...alot of the casual viewers would miss the following season's opener...why? because all the plotpoints they were emotionally tied up in had ended the following season...the new season wouldn't be as interesting...now they're all gonna be checking their tv guide's for next season's first episode...how brilliant...so to the powers that be: bravo...you pulled it out...i don't think anyone expected it with such a new show...it seemed too good to be true...but you did it...you wrote a strong script...you accrued many faithful viewers...and as a result, constructed a great television hit...here's to next fall and the new adventures that ensue with the gang from orange county, california...

if you didn't pick up on it, that ever-so-fitting final song played over the closing montage was none other than jeff buckley's "hallelujah"...how perfect was that while seth's boat sailed off into the sunset...perfect i tell you...perfect...

that's it...i need to go to film school...i will be a screenwriter one of these days...

<em>"maybe there's a God above...but all i ever learned from love...was how to shoot somebody who outdrew yah...and it's not a cry that you hear at night...it's not somebody who's seen the light...it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah...hallelujah..."</em>
