ok so i lied...i'm not gonna post any reviews of the shows i went to last weekend...it will just take too much of my precious time and to be honest, i forget things very fast...so i will give you a brief synopsis...thurs. jan 23rd i went to see lovedrug/brazil/and brandtson at the grog shop in cleveland...we got there a little late because of the inclimate weather but ended up being very early...the show started an hour and a half late because the guitarist from lovedrug got stuck in traffic/weather...lucky for us, lead singer michael shepard decided to appease the impatient crowd by unveiling some of his solo material which was nothing less than amazing...when the long-lost guitarist finally arrived there was only time for lovedrug to play 3 songs which was too short but well worth it...during the setup for the next band brazil...josh and i ran to a local drug store for some ear plugs...the sound system in the grog shop has a tendency to become a little unbearable...so i packed those in my ears tight and didn't hear much of brazil...which by the way it looked didn't bother me that much...don't go out of your way to see them...next up was brandtson...don't get me wrong...i like them alot...always will...but i've just seen them one too many times...they play a show about once a month and there is never a shortage of chances to see them...they also promised to have a new recording around this time and now i find out it isn't out until april in stores and march if you see them on tour...quite depressing...they played some of their new material but it just isn't as fun when you can't sing along with them...so that concert was somewhat of a letdown...for a review of the other concert i attended last weekend...tune in next time...this entry is shaping up to be too long...

well speaking of concerts...tonite i'm off to band practice w/ josh and coby for our performance opening up for ace troubleshooter a week from today...yikes! that's soon...so if you haven't already heard you need to come out to this show it's gonna kick...go to my bud <a href="http://www.xanga.com/dreamerswell" target="_blank">dave's page</a> and read all the details on the show...

over and out...
