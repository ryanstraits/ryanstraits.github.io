well we initially thought we were playing virginia beach but the show actually ended up being in norfolk...they're right next to each other but i thought i'd just clear that up for the record...hah...the drive from  harrisonburg to norfolk was about 3 hours...the show was set up by this really cool guy, james...he had done a few shows with chris in the past and definitely knew what he was doing...it's always nice to do shows with good promoters...they make a huge difference...<br /><br />the place we played at was called "the boot"...it was this neat bar/restaurant...i guess as neat as norfolk, virginia can be...the show went pretty well and quite a few people showed up for it...the best part of the night thought was the sleeping accomodations james hooked us up with...he didn't really have a place for us to stay so he set up some tents at these campgrounds on the chesapeake bay...it was very rad...we roasted weenies and smores and all that good stuff...a few of his friends came out and we told some stories around the campfire...it had been a while since i had "traditionally" camped out so it was fun for me personally...<br /><br />the next day was an off day for us...the next show we had to play was savannah, georgia so we just kind of kicked it around virginia beach for the day...james took us to the beach and we just walked around and had a few smoothies...he also took us to this cool burrito bar as well...we then started driving towards georgia...we initially planned to stop for the night and get a hotel in fayetteville, nc but ended up going all the way to florence, sc before we felt like stopping...we took our time though and stopped at some cheesy interstate outlets along the way...really taking in all the sights, ya know...<br /><br />we got a hotel in florence and then made the short drive to savannah (about 2-3 hours) which is where i am now...so i'll stop there...we're playing tonight at this cool coffee shop called "the sentient bean"...it's in the historical (aka uber-cool) district of savannah...but i'll talk more about that tomorrow...<br /><br />i can't believe i'm actually caught up on the journal...i'm so proud of myself...<br /><br />only 4 more days til we're home...
