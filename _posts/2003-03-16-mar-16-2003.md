<span style="font-family:Verdana;">for some reason i'm in a pleasantly cheerful mood today and i can't quite figure out why...i had to get up early this morning...and have been mighty tired ever since...i have two exams early tomorrow morning and i haven't even blinked at any study materials from either of the two classes...i guess it must be the weather...i mean how can you be down and dreary when it's 74 degrees in march?</span>

i also watched two movies this afternoon that took me back to my early high school days which was kinda nostalgic in a weird way...props to usa for airing "can't hardly wait" and "10 things i hate about you" back-to-back this afternoon...it was somwhat refreshing...i do have to say the usa network is moving farther up in my book lately since they took a nose-dive a few years back for ousting macgyver re-runs from their weekday after-school line-up...i still don't know if i can ever forgive them for that...

on to my real life adventures...i did in fact start my new job at pro-foam this past week and it wasn't half-bad (and never less than that...) and i don't think i'm gonna mind working there for a while...however, if i do experience any negativity from working there in the near future, it will probably fade away when i receive my first paycheck...anyways, all i'm doing right now is dull, mindless slave labor that doesn't really involve that much hard work (it's just a foam plant so there's not much heavy lifting, obviously) but we work hard for 8 hours solid and that gets rough compared to the wimpy 6 hour shifts i used to work at beachy's...but i'm actually starting to like working hard and i feel like i'm really earning my pay...kinda sounds strange coming from me i know, but i guess half of it's probly because i'm realizing that this job is something i could never do for the rest of my life...which is a good thing...

so judging by the flurry of comments i've been getting lately from my most recent posts i can now confirm what i've thought all along...no one reads this or really cares...so now you know why i only post once every week...but if no one reads this then who are you anyways?
