There are days I wake up as if I've been startled from some strange dream.

<!-- break -->

And all at once, I'm a single man again who's somehow found himself lying in a married man's bed. I'm a father sliding my feet back into a bachelor's shoes. I look in the mirror and find the lined, graying face staring back at me unrecognizable. A starry fog washes over me and I'm suddenly privy to the cracks in the alternate universe I've come to find myself in.

I go about my day with the nagging guilt that I've somehow stolen this beautiful life from some other charmed version of myself. I lumber through my daily routine like it's second nature to be living this peculiar man's life. Tripping over hair bows and toy trucks that have mysteriously found their way to my floor.

When the day is done, I come home and expect to only hear the empty thud of the door as it latches behind me.

Instead, I'm greeted by the pitter-patter of little feet. And tiny shrieks of joy.

"Dada! Dada!"

And all the warmth and color of the world floods back in.

_This is my life._

And this is undoubtedly my golden age.

Nine years ago, I was just a _kid_ living solo in a one-bedroom apartment only 10 miles from my childhood home. I was working an entry-level drafting job at the local window factory. I had no forward momentum and no prospects for gaining any steam.

I wasn't a dad yet, but I was nearing deadbeat status.

As I [previously mentioned](http://blog.ryanstraits.com/2018/05/14/part-3-a-grown-up-soul.html), I had got some traveling under my belt during that period of my life. I was in a fun indie-rock band for a few years and on the praise band at church. I had some great friends. I went to the local community college, paid as I went, and wound up saving myself a lot of debt in the process. And since I had never moved too far from my hometown, family was always close by.

These were all great things! So why then was I so profoundly unhappy during that period of my life? Why was I spending my Friday nights at home in my apartment alone, strumming my guitar, playing Madden '09 on an original Xbox, and falling asleep on the couch after downing half a six-pack?

Nights like these happened frequently in my later twenties. And as proud of that time of life as I am, and the growth and independence I fostered then, I still don't quite know how to frame the unique sadness I felt. I think more than anything, I was just very blue.

The kind of feeling that your life should be something else but it just isn't yet.

A combination of friends moving away, or getting married and starting families ripped any of the common ground I once shared with them right out from under my feet. It was just a lonely time. I guess if my life had a low point, this was undeniably it.

Now, I'm not naive enough to think that I have had any kind of a cursed life. I was, and am still, incredibly privileged and blessed. It's not that my life was heading in some bad direction. _It's that it just wasn't heading in any particular direction at all._

In a life full of mostly safe and orderly choices, I came to a fork in the road ahead. I needed a decision that I couldn't turn back from. So I moved four states away, married a cute girl, and the rest is [history](http://blog.ryanstraits.com/2010/07/05/choose-your-own-adventure.html). That decision proved to be a much needed jolt to my social life. A brand new city to explore with a brand new group of friends! A girl to fall in love and start a new life with.

It was great and I very much love my life and that girl and those friends and this new-ish home away from home. But that freshness eventually wore off, as fresh things are wont to do. And that pesky blueness somehow stuck around. Like a mental note that never quite made the leap from my short term to long term memory and slipped away. Or a paragraph that I've long since deleted, but left a blinking cursor in its place.

And now, several years later, this blueness is all grown up in a tucked in shirt, with responsibilities, a career, and mouths to feed. And it's morphed itself into something I've come to call "[The Dad Mule](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pack%20mule)".

### The Dad Mule

###### _It should be noted that much of this entire next section could be applied to mothers just as well as it does to fathers. Likely even more so! Unfortunately though, I have no first-hand knowledge of being in a mom's shoes. So instead of looking like an ass and trying to speak for the struggles mom's face, I'm going to leave this bit of commiseration here solely for dads. My apologies to all you moms who go through more than we dads could ever imagine._

If--[as I've noted earlier](http://blog.ryanstraits.com/2018/05/21/part-4-life-in-the-future.html)--marriage is "a study in selflessness", then parenthood is more like "selflessness being forced upon you". Whether you like it or not.

There's just no getting around it. "Your needs" as a priority in your own life have been bumped down the list several notches when you become a dad. This is inescapable. That is, unless, you turn tail and run the other way. And, I have to be honest, I understand now why some dads can't handle the weight of fatherhood. It's wholly unforgivable and completely inexcusable, mind you, but for the first time in my life, I get it. As a friend said recently about his own reckoning with encroaching fatherhood, "There's just so much...consequence".

And for some people, that's just too much. Taking on the role of caregiver, guide, and co-provider--or even sole provider--of such young, fragile lives is a uniquely immense burden. And that burden can be soul crushing. It's not so much that your dreams die or go away, it's that they now take a backseat to keeping this new, little human alive.

Given, as I mentioned in my [last post](http://blog.ryanstraits.com/2018/06/18/part-5-forever-summer.html), that so many other humans are sharing in this same parenting experience, you might think that commiseration amongst the ranks is a free and frequent occurrence. But like so many quirks inherent to young parenthood, you learn quickly that it doesn't happen as often as you'd think.

You might try, at first, to solicit sympathy from friends and family on social media. This is always the first instinct. But I would proceed with caution as this will likely only reward you a heaping pile of "thoughts and prayers". You might turn to other fathers for support--and that camaraderie can be great!--but ultimately, those dads have children of their own to care for, so saddling them with your additional burden is rarely welcome.

And then there is your spouse. Open and frequent communication about your struggles in "dadding" is encouraged, but if your family works close to how mine does, then your wife or partner, likely bares the lion's share of the child rearing already. So more often than not, a verbal download of all the physical and mental stress that you're experiencing will fall on less-than-understanding ears.

So then, just who do we dads complain to in these dog days of young fatherhood? Who's up the chain from us? Is this truly just a put-up and shut-up scenario?

The answer, most often, is yes. You grin and bear it. There isn't much time for anything else. When you have a full day at work and then go home only to punch in for a full night of parenting, you have to be prepared to simply take the stress of it all solely on the chin. You move on, you go to bed, and then you wake up and do it again. At some point, the repetition of it all works you into a groove where it requires very little higher brain function at all.

This is the essence of the Dad Mule. You're just a courier now. A provider, a mess cleaner, a pain manager, a mistake inhibitor, a rule enforcer. And some days, these things are all you are. Your chief function now as a father is to get your kid(s) successfully from point A to point B successfully. It's not always about getting them there in the most elegant or efficient manner, it's simply about _getting_ them there.

From hungry to full.

From dirty to clean.

From sick to healthy.

From sad to happy.

From baby to adult.

From amateur to maturity.

It's moving this car seat to that car, then back again, then forgetting that your wife needs the car seat in her van so you turn around and take it back to her.

Some days, you literally are just a pack mule.

We got the surprise news that we were pregnant with my daughter just five months into our new marriage. Five months! To say that my world was turned upside down was a bit of an understatement. I had waited nearly _30 years_ for this married stage of my life to commence and now I was already staring down the barrel of another completely new and unknown chapter. After spending so much time as a single man, thinking about becoming a dad so soon felt like whiplash.

And so when we first saw the positive pregnancy test, I have to be honest, my initial reaction wasn't elation. It was disappointment. Don't get me wrong, the excitement came later. But you have to understand, I was looking forward to _years_ of it just being my wife and I. I was looking forward to trips, and planning, and adventures, and more planning, and spending time together, just the two of us. A baby was barely in my five year plan.

But here we were, picking out cribs, and bouncers, and breast pumps. It was all just so much. And it was all just so soon. It's then I realized that the good Lord knew I needed those nine months to prepare for the baby more than the baby needed nine months to prepare for the world.

Nine months to prepare and nine months to grieve. I'm not the best at math, but I was able to add up fairly quickly where this new baby's due date was about to put me: squarely in the realm of obsolescence.

You might think that's a bit of an over exaggeration, but this new little bouncing bundle of joy was due to be born within striking distance of my _own_ birthday. It was one of those coincidences of fate that just felt divinely comedic. This thing wasn't only going to take away the honeymoon period of my marriage, it was going to take away the one day _dedicated_ to me.

As we approached my birthday, my very pregnant wife decided to plan the biggest birthday celebration that has ever been thrown in my honor. I'm talking invites sent to nearly all our friends, streamers all over the house, spiked punch, and a bonfire out back. I think you can see where this story is heading. She was a few weeks out from her due date, so we thought we were in the clear. But wouldn't you know, the night before the big party, just as she was putting the final touches on the food and decorations, her water broke.

We gave our house keys to some friends and hurried to the hospital. We didn't want all the food and merriment to go to waste, so we insisted the party go on as planned. My daughter entered the world the following evening, just after my big birthday bash was getting underway across town.

We came home a few days later to an empty house with trash cans full of empty beer cans and "Happy Birthday" banners.

The symbolism of it all wasn't lost on me. This was the universe very clearly telling me that it was time to step aside.

The term Dad Mule is silly, I know. But it's the best way I know to boil down this experience into something relatable. The mind-numbing daily repetition and the sneaking suspicion that you're being passed over. Fatherhood _really_ is tough and it seems like no one really cares to listen.

Except, that's not _entirely_ true. Is it?

Deep down we know our families and friends _do_ care. They just don't have the time or understanding to always listen. And so that got me thinking: what if I just paid someone to listen to me?

It turns out, there are people who do actually perform this function in society. They're called licensed therapists and in the Fall of 2017, I found myself staring across from one for the very first time.

I have to admit, I felt a little strange seeking out a counsellor for my miniscule problems.

I wound up seeing a licensed therapist for the better part of a year and it was hands down one of the best decisions I've ever made.

My reasons for seeking out mental health therapy aren't that complex: I am in the middle of one of the most stressful and anxious periods of my life. Career, kids, marriage, family. And I honestly just needed someone to work through all of it with.

I needed someone completely outside my world to listen to me and tell me that what I was feeling is valid. An unbiased third party who could take an honest look at me and tell me I wasn't crazy. Side note: If you've never had another human being look at you and honestly tell you that you're not crazy for what you're feeling, you really need to try it some time. It may be one of the most healing things we can hear.

Now, I know that the state of healthcare in this country means that cost is often a factor in making these kinds of decisions (and it was for me too), but I would encourage anyone considering therapy to do what you can to make it happen. If not for you, then for your family. Because I view my family as the biggest beneficiaries of me getting therapy. As a spouse and a parent, there's a relief that comes with getting your own mental baggage figured out so that it doesn't weigh on those around you. Help yourself so that you can help others.

I would also encourage you, if you've thought about getting therapy, to seek out a licensed professional. Pastors and friends are really great and each can provide wise counsel & comfort. But there really is no substitute for someone who is trained & does this work for a living.

I'll be honest, talking about my mental health is normally the type of thing I very much like to keep private. But there's still a certain stigma associated with therapy that keeps many of us away. So my hope is that by sharing this publicly, it may help lessen that stigma even a little for someone else.

I've been surprised at how many dads and husbands I've talked to since I started this journey that are having their own private struggles with anxiety as well. So if that's you too, you can be sure you're not alone, and it's OK to reach out. I know it can be awkward and scary at first but I promise you, it's worth the effort.

Therapy is like reading a book as opposed to reading about a book. You know what itʼs going to say, but thereʼs still a journey in the reading. In the slow methodical mouthing of the words.

So yes, the Dad Mule is silly but the struggle is definitely still real.

But all this struggle. All this mind-numbing routine. I promise that it's so worth it.

It's worth it for the tickle fights. The nights you squeal with glee with your kids in a way you haven't since _you_ were a kid. It's worth it when your daughter snuggles up under the crook of your arm and falls asleep. When your son asks you to play Spiderman vs. Hulk for the 15th time.

My God, young dad, it's so worth it.

So deal with what you need to so that you can be fully present and fully alive for your family. There's no amount of money

Dad mule end: the superpowers that are inherited; uncanny ability to put up with bullshit, drown out crying or whining children; ups your tolerance for things that annoy you to a whole other level

Parenthood is tough, but it is very simple. Itʼs mostly learning to get out of your kids way. You donʼt have the power to make them into rousing success stories. But you do have the power to wreck them. The sooner you learn that you are more a guardrail than a backseat driver, the better off youʼll be.
