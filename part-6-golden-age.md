There are days I wake up as if I've been startled from some strange dream.

<!-- break -->

And all at once, I'm a single man again who somehow found himself laying in a married man's bed. I'm a father sliding my feet back into a bachelor's slippers. It's then that this starry fog washes over me and I'm suddenly privy to the cracks in the alternate universe I've come to find myself in. I look in the mirror and don't recognize the lined, graying face staring back at me. I go about my day with the nagging guilt that I've somehow stolen this beautiful life from some other charmed version of myself.

I lumber through my daily routine like it's second nature to be living this peculiar man's life. Tripping over hair bows and toy trucks that have accidentally found their way to my floor. When the day is done, I come home and half expect to only hear the empty thud of the door as it latches behind me.

Instead, I'm greeted with the pitter-patter of little feet. And tiny shrieks of joy.

"Dada! Dada!"

And all the warmth and color of the world suddenly floods back in.

Is this is really my life?

This is my golden age.

***

Just eight years ago, I was just a single guy living in that shabby one-bedroom apartment on 3rd Street. I was working an entry-level drafting job at the local window factory. I had no forward momentum and no prospects for gaining any steam.

I wasn't a dad yet, but I was nearing deadbeat status.

As I [previously mentioned](http://blog.ryanstraits.com/2018/05/14/part-3-a-grown-up-soul.html), I had got some traveling under my belt. I was in a fun rock band for a few years. I had some great friends. I went to the local community college, paid as I went, and wound up saving myself a lot of debt in the process. I never moved too far from my hometown, so family was always close by.

These were all great things! So why then was I so unhappy during that period of my life? Why was I spending my Friday nights at home in my apartment alone, strumming my guitar, playing Madden '09, and falling asleep on the couch after downing half a six-pack.

Nights like these happened too frequently in my later twenties. And as proud of that time of life as I am, and the growth and independence I fostered, I still don't quite know how to frame the unique sadness I felt then. I think more than anything, I was just very blue.

The kind of feeling that your life should be something else but it just isn't yet.

A combination of friends getting married and other friends starting families ripped any of the common ground we once shared right out from under my feet. It was just a lonely time. If my life had a low point, this was undeniably it.

Now, I'm not naive enough to think that I had any kind of a cursed life. I was, and am still, incredibly privileged and blessed. It's not that my life was heading in some bad direction. _It's that it just wasn't heading in any particular direction at all._

In a life full of mostly safe and orderly choices, I needed a decision that I couldn't turn back from. So I met a girl, I moved four states away and the rest is [history](http://blog.ryanstraits.com/2010/07/05/choose-your-own-adventure.html). That decision proved to be a much needed jolt to my social life. A brand new city to explore with a brand new group of friends! A girl to fall in love and start a new life with.

It was great and I very much love my life and that girl and those friends and this new home away from home. But freshness eventually wore off, as fresh things are wont to do.

And that pesky blueness somehow stuck around. Like a mental note that never quite made it from my short term to long term memory. Or a paragraph that I long since deleted, but the cursor is still sitting there, blinking.

And now, several years later, this blueness is all grown up, with responsibilities, a career, and mouths to feed. It's something that I've started to call "[The Dad Mule](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pack%20mule)".

### The Dad Mule

_It should be noted that much of this entire section could be applied to mothers just as well as it does to fathers. Likely even more so! Unfortunately though, I have no first-hand knowledge of being in a mom's shoes. So instead of looking like an ass and trying to speak for the struggles mom's face, I'm going to leave this bit of commiseration here solely for dads. My apologies to all you moms who go through more than we dads could ever imagine._

If, as I've noted earlier, marriage is "a study in selflessness", then parenthood is more like "selflessness being forced upon you". Whether you like it or not.

There's just no getting around it. "Your needs" as a priority in your own life have been bumped down the list several notches when you become a dad. This is inescapable. That is, unless, you turn tail and run the other way.

And, I have to be honest, I understand now why some dads can't handle the weight of fatherhood. It's wholly unforgivable and completely inexcusable, mind you, but for the first time in my life, I get it. As a friend said recently about his own reckoning with encroaching fatherhood, "There's just so much...consequence".

And for some people, that's just too much. Taking on the role of caregiver, guide, and co-provider--or sole provider--of such young, fragile lives is a uniquely immense burden. And that burden can be soul crushing. It's not so much that your dreams die or go away, it's just that they now take a backseat to keeping this new, little human alive.

Given, as I mentioned previously, so many other humans are sharing in this same parenting experience, you might think that commiseration amongst the ranks is a free and frequent occurrence. But like so many quirks with parenthood, you may be surprised to learn that it doesn't happen as often as you'd think.

You might try, at first, to solicit sympathy from friends and family on social media, but I would proceed with caution as that will likely only get you a heaping pile of "thoughts and prayers". You might turn to other fathers for support--and that camaraderie can be a great thing!--but ultimately, those dads have children of their own to care for, so saddling them with your burden is rarely welcome.

And then there is your spouse. Open and frequent communication about your struggles in "dadding" is encouraged, but if your family works like mine, then your wife or partner, probably bears the lion's share of the child rearing. So more often than not, a verbal download of all the physical and mental stress that you're experiencing will fall on less-than-understanding ears.

So then, just who do we dads complain to when the going gets tough? Who's up the chain from us? Is this truly just a put-up and shut-up scenario?

The answer is most often: yes. You grin and bear it. When you have a full day at work and then go home only to punch in for a full night of parenting, you have to be prepared to simply take the stress of it all solely on the chin. You move on, you wake up, and then you do it again. At some point, the repetition of it all works you into a groove where it requires very little higher brain function at all.

This is the essence of what I've come to call: "The Dad Mule". I'm simply a courier now. And sometimes, that's all I am. My chief function as a dad is to get my kids from point A to point B successfully. It's not always about getting them there in the most elegant or efficient manner, it's just about getting them there.

From hungry to full.

From dirty to clean.

From sick to healthy.

From sad to happy.

From baby to adult.

From amateur to maturity.

It's moving this car seat to that car, then back again, then forgetting that your wife needs the car seat in her van so you turn around and take it back to her. Sometimes in parenthood, all you are is a simple pack mule. Many nights, after getting the kids bathed, calmed down, and successfully to bed, I collapse in a heap of spent energy and frayed emotions.

These are the dog days of young fatherhood.

We got the surprise news that we were pregnant with my daughter just five months into our new marriage. Five months! To say that my world was turned upside down was a bit of an understatement. I had waited nearly _30 years_ for this married stage of life and now I was already staring down the barrel of another completely new and unknown chapter. After spending so much time single, thinking about becoming a dad so soon felt like whiplash.

And so when we first saw the positive pregnancy test, I have to be honest, my initial reaction wasn't elation. It was disappointment. Don't get me wrong, the excitement came later. But you have to understand, I was looking forward to _years_ of it just being my wife and me. I was looking forward to trips and adventures and spending time just the two of us. A baby was barely in our five year plan.

But here we were, picking out cribs and bouncers and breast pumps. It was all just so much. And it was all just so soon. It's then I realized that the good Lord knew I needed those nine months to prepare for the baby more than the baby needed nine months to prepare for the world.

Nine months to prepare and nine months to grieve. I'm not the best at math, but I was able to add up fairly quickly where this new baby's due date was about to put me: squarely in the realm of obsolescence. You might think that's a bit of an over exaggeration, but this new little bouncing bundle of joy was due to be born within striking distance of my _own_ birthday. It was one of those coincidences of fate that just felt divinely comedic. This thing wasn't only going to take away the honeymoon period of my marriage, it was going to take away the one day _dedicated_ to me.

As we approached my birthday, my very pregnant wife decided to plan the biggest birthday celebration that has ever been thrown in my honor. I'm talking invites sent to nearly all my friends, streamers all over my house, spiked punch, and a bonfire out back. I think you can see where this story is heading. She was a few weeks out from her due date, so we thought we were in the clear. But sure enough, the night before the big party, as she was putting the final touches on the food and decorations, her water broke.

We gave the keys to our house to some friends and hurried to the hospital. We didn't want all the food and merriment to go to waste, so we insisted the party go on as planned. My daughter entered the world the following evening, just after my big birthday bash was getting under way across town.

We came home a few days later to an empty house with trash cans full of empty beer cans and "Happy Birthday" banners.

The symbolism of it all was not lost on me. This was the universe saying very clearly, "It's time to step aside, son."

\---

So, what do we do then? Do we just let the mind-numbing repetition beat us up over and over again? Is there any hope for rising above

The term Dad Mule is silly, I know. But it's the best way I know to boil down this experience into something relatable.

But here's the thing. All this struggle. All this mind-numbing routine. It's worth it.

It's worth it for the tickle fights. The nights you squeal with glee with your kids in a way you haven't since _you_ were a kid. It's worth it when your daughter snuggles up under the crook of your arm and falls asleep. My God, young dad, it's so worth it.

\## Present Nostalgia

On particularly taxing days, I find my mind drifting back to those bachelor days of mine. Yeah, you know, the time when I was probably depressed. Those are the times that I fantasize about now as a dad. Sure, that was maybe the bleakest time in my life, seemingly waiting forever for something to break in my favor.

But man that kid had so much free time. He had so much time to dream about possibilities. To sit around and stoop in his sadness. What a gift.

I keep coming back to time because I believe parenthood is the first instance when you truly begin to realize it's worth. That gift of time that I had as a younger man has been cashed in for short, frenetic days of screaming kids and leaking diapers. For first year molars and gymnastics classes.

You barely have enough time to think, let alone dream.

I'm nostalgic for that period of my life. I know I'll be nostalgic for this period of life right now. Try to live with a present nostalgia. Realizing that I'm going to miss these days immensely, so I need to make sure I live in them fully present.

Ending: "present" nostalgia. Look at the things I know I'll look back on from this time and feel that presence now. House we live in, way the light comes through the trees, children young, etc.

I've got a front row seat right now to what I will likely later consider to be the best times of my life.

Because before I know it, I'll be sitting across the table from a young father asking me "How did you do it? Raise your kids, stay married, keep your sanity?"

And I'll tell him, "I did it by savoring every moment that I could..."

"Because the whole thing is a gift."

We once were babies born of fresh winter snows

Coming of age in the cool rains of spring

And baked to form in July's sweltering glaze.

But oh how we long for the summer to stay

And keep our minds from the seasons to come!

That is, until our sun-swept brows grow weary

And our lungs stifled with thick morning haze

It's only then we shift our gaze

To the bare breezes of autumn

When the sun slowly loses it's luster

And our breath finds its just relief.

"To everything there is a season."

Fall will come

And it's Sister on it's heels.

Winter. Our hearth, our home

And where we will be born anew.
