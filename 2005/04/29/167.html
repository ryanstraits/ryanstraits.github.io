<p><strong><span style="color:#009999">ryan&#39;s ten most anticipated movies of the summer
</span></strong><em>2005 edition</em></p>

<!-- break -->

<p><strong>1. batman begins</strong> - from birth i have had a propensity towards the more human superheros...as much as i love superman and spidey...there&#39;s just something about a hero with no superpowers that really appeals to me...for that reason batman is without a doubt my favorite...i used to spend my afternoons after school plopped in front of the tv mesmerized by the batman animated series...it&#39;s just too bad that none of the many batman movies over the past 20 years or so (except maybe tim burton&#39;s original <em>batman</em>) have done justice to this amazing story...from what i can tell from this latest rendition...it looks like christopher nolan has actually done it right...plus it&#39;s an origin story...and i diiiiig origin stories...i don&#39;t think i&#39;ve been this excited for a movie&#39;s release since...well, since never...this is gonna be one heck of a movie...do yourself a favor and go watch the full trailer <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/wb/batman_begins/trailer4/" target="_new">here</a>...</p>

<p><strong>2. star wars episode 3: revenge of the sith</strong> - i have a thing for epic movies...and this one may very well be one of the most epic (save maybe the <em>lord of the rings</em> series) of all time...the turn of anakin skywalker/darth vader to the dark side? i don&#39;t care if you hate star wars...this is huge...the entire star wars series hinges upon this movie...and i really don&#39;t think george lucas is going to let us down...his legacy depends on it...</p>

<p><strong>3. bewitched</strong> - two words: will ferrell...three words: old school remake...well that last one doesn&#39;t really constitute a good movie as we&#39;ve all seen over the past few years...this was actually a tv show i watched on nick at nite back when...well, back when i used to actually watch nick at nite...aka: a loooong time ago...it looks like they&#39;re going about this remake in a fresh way too which i think will set it apart from such an overcrowded genre...</p>

<p><strong>4. mr. &amp; mrs. smith</strong> - oooh it&#39;s the flick that supposedly broke brannifer up...how sad...it does look like it should be pretty darn good however..a married couple who doesn&#39;t know that they&#39;re both secret agents hired to kill each other...how clever...and with doug liman (<em>the bourne identity</em>) behind the camera i&#39;m expecting great things...hopefully they just let the chemistry between brad and angelina work it&#39;s magic and hold off on all the cheesy action...i think there&#39;s definite potential for this one...plus i heard adam brody&#39;s in it...i also heard that he needs to be my new best friend...</p>

<p><strong>5. war of the worlds</strong> - it&#39;s another spielberg and cruise pairing...man once these high-profile types find a good working buddy they just don&#39;t like to part ways with them (see <em>charlie and the chocolate factory</em> below for more on this phenomena)...they really rushed the production on this movie so i really am skeptical of the story (they just wrapped filming in like january...pretty unheard of for a major blockbuster release)...i&#39;m sure the production values will be high though given the fact spielberg&#39;s involved...the acting should be top-notch with cruise, dakoda fanning and tim robbins all getting top billing...but how can they really make such an old, overused plotline like &quot;aliens taking over the world&quot; into an interesting story? i have faith they could pull it off i guess...and if they can that would definitely be the best special effect they could ever come up with...</p>

<p><strong>6. charlie and the chocolate factory</strong> - alright so here&#39;s the other dynamic duo in hollywood coming to us with another big release this summer...tim burton and johnny depp...i believe this is their fourth movie together and they have yet another slated for release later this year (the eerie, animated <em>corpse bride</em>)...this flick does look promising...everyone knows depp can pull of the quirkiness needed for the role of willy wonka...but man those trailers showing him in character look just flat-out strange...he looks almost androgynous...and that&#39;s a little freaky...but then again it is tim burton...so these things are to be expected...i guess...one high point i must say is their choice for the role of charlie, freddie highmore...who definitely showed his acting chops in last years <em>finding neverland</em>...where he co-starred with none other than...that&#39;s right...johnny depp...geesh, these actor folks don&#39;t like to make new friends do they?</p>

<p><strong>7. fantastic four</strong> - i don&#39;t know how fantastic this film looks to be honest...i think &quot;fantastic&quot; wore off a long time ago when it comes to the recent onslaught of comic-book remakes...i think <em>batman begins</em> has what it takes to break that mold...i like this trend of hiring more &quot;indie-esque&quot; directors to handle the big budget flicks...but anyways...fantastic four...i was dreaming about how amazing <em>batman begins</em> is gonna be again...i&#39;m sorry...what was i talking about? oh fantastic four...is that movie coming out this summer? yea it looks alright...</p>

<p><strong>8. cinderella man</strong> - ooh i almost forgot about this pairing...it&#39;s hollywood A-list matchup numero tres...ron howard and russell crowe...they have the whole &quot;based-on-a-true-story-but-slightly-exaggerated-to-make-for-a-feel-good/moving/touching-cinematic-experience&quot; market pretty much cornered i&#39;d say...one more of these and they&#39;ve got a franchise...<em>a beautiful mind</em> made it&#39;s mark...and i don&#39;t see <em>cinderella man</em> as being much different...they definitely have the formula going...this one takes on the true story (of course) of a depression-era boxer who&#39;s all down on his luck but gets his act together just in time for the climax and resolution...who knows...i may even end up shedding a few tears...</p>

<p><strong>9. madagascar</strong> - most of you know i am a sucker for these new computer-animated kiddie flicks...the funny thing is most of the humor is over the kids heads anyways...they didn&#39;t have movies like that when we were kids did they? i wonder if we woulda thought they were as cool as these kids think they are...maybe today&#39;s youngsters are just a whole heckuva lot smarter than we were...hmm it&#39;s food for thought...at any rate...madagascar stays true to the formula put in place by <em>toy story/shrek/etc</em>. and most recently <em>the incredibles</em>...all you gotta do is find yourself a decent plot...throw in a few popular comedian voice-overs...and you got yourself a box office smash...</p>

<p><strong>10. the wedding crashers</strong> - i should actually place this movie higher up on my list...but it&#39;s looking like it could be a bit filthy so it landed itself at spot no. 10...but it&#39;s definitely another frat-pack movie as owen wilson and vince vaughn are starring...it&#39;s a comedy about two guys who go around to various weddings to pick up lonely women...how great...the plot sounds hilarious...and i&#39;ve often wondered if guys have ever used that same strategy to pick up women before...obviously you can see where the rauchiness could come in...but if it stays relatively kosher this could be my top comedy pick of the summer (or maybe even year)...</p>

<p><span style="color:#009999;">---</span></p>

<p>there are a few others i could give a noteworthy mention to here as well...but i figure what&#39;s the use really?...there&#39;s upcoming movies like &quot;the dukes of hazzard&quot;, &quot;the island&quot;, &quot;domino&quot; that have caught my eye...but really i&#39;m not dying to see any of them...they may end up being decent flicks...but why bother putting them on a list of movies i&#39;m greatly anticipating right?...</p>

<p>i may, however, think up a list of the summer&#39;s worst-looking movies if i feel up to it (and if there&#39;s enough hollywood fodder out there for me to openly and unashamedly blast)...that would definitely be an interesting read i guarantee you...you know the hollywood formula...for every one great piece of cinema per year...there&#39;s 10 or more dreadfully horrible movies that the studios obviously feel obligated to release in that same year...so for those keeping score at home that&#39;s:</p>

<p><strong>1</strong> studio release year = <strong>1</strong> good movie <strong>:</strong> <strong>10 + n</strong> bad movies</p>

<p>you do the math...</p>

<p><span style="color:#009999;">---</span></p>

<p>that is all...good day fellow lollygaggers...</p>
