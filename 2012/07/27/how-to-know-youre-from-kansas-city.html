          <p>About nine years ago when I still lived in Ohio, two of my good friends at the time just so happened to be from Missouri and Kansas. It&#39;s kind of a long story how they got there, but it could be said that they found a lot of our local idiosyncrasies hilarious. One day they decided to compile a  fairly smarting list of these quirky traits and emailed it to all of their Ohio friends for a good laugh (it was 2003, we emailed a lot back then). They wrote it all under the moniker &quot;The MO-KAN Connection&quot;.</p>

<!-- <a href="2005-08-22-108" target="_blank">fairly smarting list</a> -->

<!-- break -->

<p>I&#39;ll admit, I didn&#39;t take it as kindly then as I do looking back on it now. It was pretty darn funny. But sometimes it&#39;s not very much fun to listen to someone with an outside perspective make jokes about &quot;your town&quot; or &quot;your upbringing&quot;. I was born and raised in T-County (Tuscarawas County for long, and yea they made fun of the name too), so sometimes I just didn&#39;t know any different. It&#39;s good every now and then to take a look at things from a different point of view (keep this in mind as you continue reading).</p>

<p>Cuz now, the tables have turned.</p>

<p>It&#39;s nine years later, and I&#39;ve been living in Kansas City for over two years. Both those friends of mine have moved back to the Greater Kansas City area as well, so it&#39;s time for me to give my own little dose of perspective on their home city/state (one of them is actually from Springfield but many of these still apply). Now granted, KC may not be as quirky as Ohio Amish country, I&#39;ll give you that. But you guys still do some pretty crazy stuff out here.</p>

<p>So here goes, make sure to read this knowing the love behind which it was crafted. Also, read it with humility. Cuz it&#39;s all preeeeeeetty much true.</p>

<h3>You know you&#39;re from Kansas City if...<br></h3>

<ol>
<li>You think KU vs. MU is one of the most storied rivalries in college sports.</li>
<li>You can&#39;t wait to take out-of-town guests to see the spectacle that is The Plaza.</li>
<li>You call two slabs of meat on a plain piece of white bread with a dollop of BBQ sauce and a pickle on the side &quot;good BBQ&quot;.</li>
<li>You think people from Johnson County can drive.</li>
<li>You call a trip to the Ozarks &quot;a vacation&quot;.</li>
<li>You don&#39;t think it&#39;s weird that the &quot;University of Kansas&quot; and the &quot;University of Missouri&quot; are abbreviated KU &amp; MU instead of UK &amp; UM.</li>
<li>You don&#39;t understand why the previous statement was included in this list.</li>
<li>You&#39;re considering moving from the suburbs to the city just so you&#39;ll be assured of getting Google Fiber.</li>
<li>You actually enjoy the ketchup &amp; mustard color scheme that the Chiefs have employed since that combination of colors actually looked good together back in nineteen-NEVER.</li>
<li>You really did think it was &quot;Our Time&quot;.</li>
<li>You place the word &quot;highway&quot; after the road it is referring to instead of before like the rest of America, e.g. &quot;71 highway&quot;, &quot;69 highway&quot;, etc.</li>
<li>You&#39;ve never heard of a drive-thru liquor store.</li>
<li>You could lead someone right to Truman&#39;s birthplace like the whole of your existence depends on you knowing this information.</li>
<li>You can name with astounding certainty which Kansas City news anchors are gay.</li>
<li>You defy all pronunciation rules and logic by saying the word ornery (oRn-er-y) like this: &quot;on-ree&quot;. (Ohio friends: Yes, that&#39;s really how they say it)</li>
<li>&quot;Have you been to the Plaza yet? You&#39;ve got to check out the Plaza.&quot;</li>
<li>You actually believe that you get better cell reception on your Sprint phone just because their world headquarters is in OP.</li>
<li>You know the best times to avoid the lines at Oklahoma Joe&#39;s.</li>
<li>You&#39;ve been mugged at least once.</li>
<li>Your car has been broken into at least once.</li>
<li>Your house has been broken into at least once.</li>
<li>You&#39;ve never questioned why such a ridiculously asinine statement like &quot;Rock Chalk Jayhawk&quot; is your school&#39;s battle cry.</li>
<li>You know what &quot;The Triangle&quot; is and when to avoid it at all costs.</li>
<li>You think that arguing with your buddies &quot;which KC restaurant has the best BBQ in the city?&quot; is a wise use of your time.</li>
<li>You know exactly where The Goodfoot is playing tonight. Because it&#39;s the exact same place they played at last week.</li>
<li>You will only fill up your car at a Quik Trip.</li>
<li>You give directions to your home by mentioning the nearest recognizable intersection, e.g. &quot;95th &amp; Metcalf&quot;, &quot;75th &amp; Wornall&quot;, etc.</li>
<li>You consider the 6th inning sing-along to &quot;Friends in Low Places&quot; a fine Kauffman Stadium tradition, even though Garth Brooks isn&#39;t from Kansas City and it JUST MAKES NO SENSE WHATSOEVER.</li>
<li>You think Lee&#39;s Summit is just a short drive away.</li>
<li>&quot;Seriously, you haven&#39;t been to the Plaza? We need to take you to the Plaza.&quot;</li>
<li>You root for the Chiefs, the Cardinals and whichever NBA team your favorite KU player is currently on. And you can&#39;t understand why anyone would ever want to root for all the pro sports teams from just ONE city.</li>
<li>You call anything north of the river the &quot;Northland&quot;. And you REFUSE to ever go there.</li>
<li>You&#39;re not-so-secretly proud that Missouri is now considered by many to be the Meth Capital of the World.</li>
<li>You&#39;ve pronounced it &quot;Missour-uh&quot; at some point in your life.</li>
<li>You didn&#39;t know that Hyvee and PriceChopper weren&#39;t nationally recognized grocery chains until you just read this sentence.</li>
<li>You consider 90Â° to be a nice, breezy summer day.</li>
<li>You regularly go on something you call &quot;float trips&quot; in the summer. These consist of a river, some form of flotation device and a massive amount of alcohol.</li>
<li>Your claim to fame is that you went to the same high school as Paul Rudd, Jason Sudeikis and that guy from Modern Family.</li>
<li>You got a little bit too excited when Trader Joe&#39;s opened.</li>
<li>You actually root for the UMKC &#39;Roos at whatever sporting events they compete in. No really though, what sporting events do they compete in?</li>
<li>You feel that &quot;Schlitterbahn&quot; is a great name for a water park.</li>
<li>You call moving to Johnson County &quot;selling out&quot;. But you do it anyway.</li>
<li>You actually know someone who is sending their kids through the Kansas City school district.</li>
<li>The highlight of a Royals game for you is the tailgating you do beforehand.</li>
<li>You think it&#39;s normal to tailgate before a baseball game.</li>
<li>You freak out about getting your hands on some Boulevard Chocolate Ale, even though you think it tastes like liquefied Hershey bars.</li>
<li>&quot;Did you know Tech N9ne is from Kansas City?&quot; &quot;Umm, who?&quot;</li>
<li>You think the Chiefs are going to contend this year.</li>
<li>When you go out of town you tell people the name of the suburb you&#39;re from (instead of just saying you&#39;re from &quot;Kansas City&quot;), as if they&#39;ve ever heard of it!</li>
<li>You&#39;re not really offended by this list because you&#39;ve found yourself agreeing with so much of it!</li>
</ol>

<p>With love,<br>
The T-County connection</p>
