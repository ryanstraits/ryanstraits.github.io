I really thought I'd feel grown up by now. 

<!-- break -->

I mean, aren't your thirties when you're supposed to have life figured out? And if not figured out, than at least well on your way to doing so. Or I guess, that's what I had always assumed. As a younger individual, if I ever looked ahead to life as a middle-aged man, I could only envision that future version of myself as someone who thoroughly had it all together. A married man? Yes. A family man? Naturally. A career man? Check. And to top it off, the wisdom that would naturally accompany each.

This, as we know, is not how life works. Just because you're getting older in age, doesn't necessarily mean you're "growing up". Wisdom isn't just knowing more than you used to. It’s having the humility to acknowledge that the older you get, <a href="[https://twitter.com/ryanstraits/status/970835905974960128](https://twitter.com/ryanstraits/status/970835905974960128 "https://twitter.com/ryanstraits/status/970835905974960128")" target="_blank">the less you truly know</a>.

I can only assume that I'm not alone here. I know I'm still "young", but I can't say I've experienced a period in my life like this one before. Never have I had such a simultaneous flood of answers, epiphanies, and revelations flying at me all at once. And because there must always be balance in the force, those answers come laced with a bevy of newer, deeper, harder, and more existential questions.

So much so, that I felt like I needed to start writing a few things down.

Originally, I had hoped to post these musings in three simple blog posts tied loosely around themes of getting older and growing up. Well, three-plus years later and I've now got a nearly nine-part midlife memoir on my hands. It's part treatise, part advice column, part commentary, part confessional, and part gag reel. It's _a lot_, I know. I hope that by releasing it one small chunk at a time, it may promote thought, perusal, and maybe even some discussion.

And maybe you won't find yourself relating with much or any of it at all. With this guide I'm by no means claiming any particular expertise on midlife as a whole, only the parts that the soles of my shoes have touched so far. If you find yourself lost somewhere down the road, just know that there are plenty of others out there treading similar a path. If my hemming, hawing, and fumbling through this stage of life can save somebody just a few clicks back a little pain and disappointment, then I suppose I'm doing my duty as a "grown up".

Because in the end, we're all just growing up together.
