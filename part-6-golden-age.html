<hr />

<p>There are days I wake up as if I’ve been startled from some strange dream.</p>

<!-- break -->

<p>And all at once, I’m a single man again who somehow found himself laying in a married man’s bed. I’m a father sliding my feet back into a bachelor’s slippers. It’s then that this starry fog washes over me and I’m suddenly privy to the cracks in the alternate universe I’ve come to find myself in. I look in the mirror and don’t recognize the lined, graying face staring back at me. I go about my day with the nagging guilt that I’ve somehow stolen this beautiful life from some other charmed version of myself.</p>

<p>I lumber through my daily routine like it’s second nature to be living this peculiar man’s life. Tripping over hair bows and toy trucks that have accidentally found their way to my floor. When the day is done, I come home and half expect to only hear the empty thud of the door as it latches behind me.</p>

<p>Instead, I’m greeted with the pitter-patter of little feet. And tiny shrieks of joy.</p>

<p>“Dada! Dada!”</p>

<p>And all the warmth and color of the world suddenly floods back in.</p>

<p>Is this is really my life?</p>

<p>This is my golden age.</p>

<hr />

<p>Just eight years ago, I was just a single guy living in that shabby one-bedroom apartment on 3rd Street. I was working an entry-level drafting job at the local window factory. I had no forward momentum and no prospects for gaining any steam.</p>

<p>I wasn’t a dad yet, but I was nearing deadbeat status.</p>

<p>As I <a href="http://blog.ryanstraits.com/2018/05/14/part-3-a-grown-up-soul.html">previously mentioned</a>, I had got some traveling under my belt. I was in a fun rock band for a few years. I had some great friends. I went to the local community college, paid as I went, and wound up saving myself a lot of debt in the process. I never moved too far from my hometown, so family was always close by.</p>

<p>These were all great things! So why then was I so unhappy during that period of my life? Why was I spending my Friday nights at home in my apartment alone, strumming my guitar, playing Madden ‘09, and falling asleep on the couch after downing half a six-pack.</p>

<p>Nights like these happened too frequently in my later twenties. And as proud of that time of life as I am, and the growth and independence I fostered, I still don’t quite know how to frame the unique sadness I felt then. I think more than anything, I was just very blue.</p>

<p>The kind of feeling that your life should be something else but it just isn’t yet.</p>

<p>A combination of friends getting married and other friends starting families ripped any of the common ground we once shared right out from under my feet. It was just a lonely time. If my life had a low point, this was undeniably it.</p>

<p>Now, I’m not naive enough to think that I had any kind of a cursed life. I was, and am still, incredibly privileged and blessed. It’s not that my life was heading in some bad direction. <em>It’s that it just wasn’t heading in any particular direction at all.</em></p>

<p>In a life full of mostly safe and orderly choices, I needed a decision that I couldn’t turn back from. So I met a girl, I moved four states away and the rest is <a href="http://blog.ryanstraits.com/2010/07/05/choose-your-own-adventure.html">history</a>. That decision proved to be a much needed jolt to my social life. A brand new city to explore with a brand new group of friends! A girl to fall in love and start a new life with.</p>

<p>It was great and I very much love my life and that girl and those friends and this new home away from home. But freshness eventually wore off, as fresh things are wont to do.</p>

<p>And that pesky blueness somehow stuck around. Like a mental note that never quite made it from my short term to long term memory. Or a paragraph that I long since deleted, but the cursor is still sitting there, blinking.</p>

<p>And now, several years later, this blueness is all grown up, with responsibilities, a career, and mouths to feed. It’s something that I’ve started to call “<a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pack%20mule">The Dad Mule</a>”.</p>

<p>We’ll get to that in a minute. First, we need to talk a little about <em>Mary Poppins</em>. Yes, you heard me right. Specifically, we need to talk about George Banks, the bland, bulbous father figure in the 1964 Disney adaptation of the famous tale.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="the-thing-about-mary-poppins-pops">The Thing About <em>Mary Poppins’</em> Pops</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Bert:</strong> Let’s sit down. You know, begging your pardon, but the one my heart goes out to is your father. There he is, in that cold heartless bank day after day, hammed in by mounds of cold heartless money. I don’t like to see any living thing caged up.</p>

  <p><strong>Jane:</strong> Father in a cage?</p>

  <p><strong>Bert:</strong> They makes cages of all sizes and shapes, you know. Bank-shaped, some of them, carpets and all.</p>

  <p><strong>Jane:</strong> Father’s not in trouble. We are.</p>

  <p><strong>Bert:</strong> Oh. Sure about that, are you? Look at it this way. You’ve got your mother to look after you and Mary Poppins and Constable Jones and me. Who looks after your father? Tell me that. When something terrible happens, what does he do? Fends for himself, he does. Who does he tell about it? No one. Don’t blab his troubles at home. He just pushes on at his job, uncomplaining and alone and silent.</p>

  <p><strong>Michael:</strong> He’s not very silent.</p>

  <p><strong>Jane:</strong> Michael, be quiet. Bert, do you think father really needs our help?</p>

  <p><strong>Bert:</strong> Well, it’s not my place to say. I only observe that a father can always do with a bit of help. Come on, I’ll take you home.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="/assets/images/BertAndTheChildren.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<hr />

<p>This bit of dialogue is of course from the scene near the end of the film, when Bert runs into the Banks children in the back alleys of London after they had fled their Father’s <em>Fidelity Fiduciary Bank</em>.</p>

<p>I watched <em>Mary Poppins</em> a lot as a kid. Not enough that I could spell “supercalifragilisticexpialidocious”, but enough that I could sing the song from memory. My mom was a pretty big Julie Andrews fan and so my sisters and I were marinated in a lot of her work early in our lives. I have concerned many a friend with my insanely detailed lyrical recollection of the <em>Sound of Music</em>.</p>

<p>Now that my daughter is deepening her Disney movie-viewing resume, Mary Poppins was the natural next step after the animated classics. Audrey loves the “Steppin’ Time” bit just about as much as I did as a kid. It was my <em>favorite</em> part of the movie. I would’ve died to be a chimney sweep just so I could dance across all those London rooftops.</p>

<p>Audrey has taken my Steppin’ love to the next level, however. For her 3rd birthday, she wanted the party to be <em>Mary Poppins</em> themed with chimney sweeps prominently featured. “Steppin’ Time” played on a loop in the background. There’s no doubt she’s my kid.</p>

<p>Re-watching <em>Mary Poppins</em> now as an adult, with a more fully-formed brain, is quite the surreal experience I have to say. I’m amazed at some of the more abstract–and even bleak–plot points that went straight over my head as a kid. Go back and watch it again, it’s kind of a <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/leonoraepstein/mary-poppins-is-actually-an-extremely-messed-up-movie?utm_term=.relMK4KBG6#.au6qv1vMGZ" target="blank">messed up movie</a>. There are long stretches of it that are strangely melancholic and gloomy. The ascetic is dominated by gray and the weather is mostly stormy for the majority of the film. I know it was the 60’s, but that’s still quite odd for a children-focused film. And a Disney one at that.</p>

<p>The entire bit near the end where the kids accompany their father to the bank is particularly bleak. I distinctly remember it scaring me as a child. The bird woman. The tall arching buildings. The back alleys with Cockney’s poking out here and there. The whole sequence winds up culminating in Bert’s aforementioned monologue, as the children begin to see their rigid father in a whole, new light.</p>

<p>I hadn’t paid that much attention to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDsBFbjCewg" target="blank">little talk Bert gives in that scene</a> before. But then I read up a bit more on the back-story of <em>Mary Poppins</em> and it’s author, P.L. Travers, and the stranger, gloomier elements of the film started making more sense.</p>

<hr />

<p>In 2013, Disney released a film called <em>Saving Mr. Banks</em> starring Tom Hanks &amp; Emma Thompson that loosely chronicles the making of the <em>Mary Poppins</em> book into the beloved movie. It’s not a documentary, I get it, but bare with me here. In it, Hanks’ Disney is trying to win over Thompson’s Travers to get the film rights to her popular Poppins book so he can turn it into one of his signature films. She’s a tough nut to crack and he’s understandably nonplussed as his overtures at gaining her blessing are repeatedly and roundly objected.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/gallery_02.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<hr />

<p>It’s an entertaining and under-appreciated film, but the crux of the plot rests on Disney trying to get to the heart of Travers’ inspiration for the book, and why she is so persistent at protecting it by denying Disney’s recreation so many of his classic stylistic and musical touches. He had originally viewed it as a fantastical retelling of her youth growing up and thought adding song and animated creatures would fit right in with her vision.</p>

<p>He was partially correct, he finds out, but by the end realizes that he had wrongly placed the children as the central figures of the story and the reason that Mary Poppins came. And indeed, watching the movie as a kid, that was the way I interpreted it too.</p>

<p>But to do that, I had to edit out the bleaker, more <em>boring</em> scenes like the one above, or the one when Bert sings that duet with Mr. Banks while he’s cleaning his chimney brushes. I glossed over these scenes as a kid because they weren’t <em>for me</em>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/Marypoppins-disneyscreencaps_com-13503.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<hr />

<p>In fact, as Saving Mr. Banks would go on to reveal (spoilers!) Travers wrote the book in an attempt to forgive and redeem her own father.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Walt Disney:</strong> …It’s not the children she comes to save. It’s their father. It’s <em>your</em> father… Travers Goff.</p>

  <p><strong>P.L. Travers:</strong> I don’t know what you think you know about me, Walter…</p>

  <p><strong>Walt Disney:</strong> You must have loved and admired him a lot to take his name. It’s him this is all about, isn’t it? All of it, everything. Forgiveness, Mrs. Travers, it’s what I learned from your books.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s Mr. Banks that needed saving, not the kids. He, so cold and regimented in his daily routine of tuppence and fiduciary banks, had lost something somewhere along the way. And Mary Poppins didn’t literally messiah her way down from the clouds to indict the father on behalf of the children, she came to reclaim a bit of what he lost.</p>
